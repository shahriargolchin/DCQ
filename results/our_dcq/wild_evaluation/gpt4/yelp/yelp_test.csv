"Kabuto is your run-of-the-mill Japanese Steakhouse. Different stations with chefs slinging shrimp tails around the communal dining areas like it's a lunchtime magic show.

Uhhh...If I'm craving a salad with ginger dressing, which I always am, (you do too. admit it) fried rice, steak, shrimp and white sauce (DUDE) then Kabuto is king of lunch options in my book. Always super clean and full of kindhearted staff. The parking lot is super difficult to get in and out of though. 51 traffic at lunch is a beast. Good luck getting stuck behind someone trying to cut across traffic at 12pm on a weekday. It's murder. This place would greatly benefit from another exit/entrance or a stoplight. Here's hoping....\n\nYou can't really shake a stick at balanced lunch when you can have soup or a salad, veggies, fried rice and a choice of a protein for under $10 and be back out the door and headed back to the office or meeting. Glad to see these guys have taken this into account. Though, you should know that the $10 offering mostly comes in the protein department. Some may require more steak or chicken, which can be sparse. \n\nService is always quick and friendly. They do a wonderful job of memorizing orders. Rarely has it come to pass that my order has been mal-delivered. Quick on refills and I love that they always offer a to-go beverage. \""Why, yes! I would love a diet coke to go! How thoughtful!\"" Pretty much always my thought process. \n\nThis place also does full dinner options and has sushi.

Hmmm...If I have a yearning for a salad with ginger dressing, which I incessantly have, (you too. acknowledge it) fried rice, steak, shrimp, and white sauce (BRO) then Kabuto is the champion of lunch possibilities according to me. Always exceedingly tidy and packed with gentle personnel. The parking space is exceedingly tricky to access and exit though. Route 51 congestion during lunch is a monster.

Fingers crossed... \n\nYou really can't dismiss a balanced lunch when you can enjoy soup or a salad, vegetables, fried rice, and an option of protein for less than $10 and be outdoors en route back to your work or gathering. Pleased to note these guys have considered this. However, do bear in mind that the $10 deal mainly applies to the protein range. Some may need extra steak or chicken, which can be scarce. \n\nService is consistently swift and cordial. They do an outstanding job of remembering orders. It's hardly happened that my order was wrongly served. Quick on top-ups and I appreciate that they always propose a beverage for take-out. ""Yes, indeed! I would appreciate a diet coke for the road! How considerate!"" Almost always my chain of thought. \n\nThis location also offers complete dinner choices and sushi. Neither of which I have sampled until this point but would gladly accept if the choice was given. \n\nAppreciate the swift and amusing lunch/service, Kabuto!

label: 4 (5 stars)","text: This is a beautiful theatre with a gorgeous glass front which is great for watching the world go buy while having a coffee.\n\nI have fond memories of coming to this theatre to see the ballet since I was very young. I rather distinctly remember on my 9th birthday vomiting on the stairs during a performance of Cinderella. Ahh memories.\n\nBut this theatre really is lovely. Its the sort of theatre that you get a little dressed up to go to, like people used to do back in the day. I was lucky enough to see a stunning performance of the Nutcracker here in January, which obviously is mostly attributed to Scottish Ballet but the theatre played a huge role also. Everything from the sound to the lighting was fantastic and it really was a magical evening. \n\nThere is a number of bars for you to have a quick tipple during the interval, but you have to be quick out your seat because it gets very busy fast. \n\nTickets can be expensive, but it really attracts some of the better quality shows so it is worth it and it really makes for a nice evening out.

text: Popped in again to Mellow Mushroom alongside my companion Justin from Brew Bros. & a handful of our friends Monday afternoon during a bar hop on a day off. \nFirstly, I have to mention that my second visit was primarily driven by a swift reply to my initial Yelp assessment from Jay, the proprietor of Mellow Mushroom.  I was not anticipating any feedback, let alone one returned so rapidly. Appreciation for that. It's wonderful to observe such close care being paid to clientele. This would only yield positive outcomes.\nThe identical draught choice as during the inaugural visit. 48 taps. That's a significant quantity of beer. As articulated in my initial critique, I would relish seeing an increased diversity and a dash of creativity in relation to the draught beer options, however who would protest against such an assortment with at least 40 craft beers on draught? That's a genuine dedication.\nOur mixologist Madison showcased enthusiasm for the brews she was distributing, which in Arizona's burgeoning craft beer scene, is a substantial bonus. Additionally, on this occasion, the meal I requested was served rather promptly from the kitchen. Merely a Mediterranean salad, yet satisfying nonetheless.\nIn conclusion, it's fantastic to observe another craft beer aficionado joining the ranks. It's refreshing to have you in our midst.

text: Returned again to Mellow Mushroom with my buddy Justin from Brew Bros. & a portion of our crew Monday afternoon amid bar hopping on a free day. \nPrimarily, I have to state that my recurring visit was inspired by a prompt reaction to my initial Yelp commentary from Jay, the owner of Mellow Mushroom. I wasn't expecting any reaction, much less a reply so promptly. Kudos for that. It's admirable to witness such meticulous attention being paid to patrons.\nThis could only lead to better things. \nThe same array of draft beers as the previous time. 48 faucets. That's an extensive amount of beer. As mentioned in my previous review, with 48 faucets, I would prefer to see a broader range and a slight sense of innovation regarding the draft beer selection, yet again who would object to a line-up with at least 40 craft beers on tap? That's a solid commitment.\nOur barmaid Madison was excited about the drinks she was offering, which in Arizona's expanding craft beer industry is a substantial advantage. On a different note, during this visit, the dish I ordered was swiftly prepared from the kitchen. Just a Mediterranean salad, but pleasant.\nAltogether, it's pleasing to see another craft beer enthusiast enter the scene. It's good to have you around.

I didn't foresee any answers, let alone a revert so speedily. Kudos for that. It's impressive to see a level of dedication towards customer service.\nThis can only result in positive improvements.\nThe same variety of draft beers as the initial time. 48 spigots. That's a substantial load of beer. As stated in my prior assessment, with 48 spigots, I would delight in seeing a wider array and some inventive flair pertaining to the draft beer choices, but then who would gripe about a spread that includes at least 40 craft beers on tap? That's a true commitment.\nOur bartender Madison was passionate about the beers she was dispensing, which in the escalating craft beer society of Arizona, is a significant advantage. On another aspect, this time the food I requisitioned came out of the kitchen exceptionally fast. Just a Mediterranean salad, but worth mentioning.\nAll in all, it's splendid to welcome another craft beer comrade to the fraternity. Happy to have you present.

label: 3 (4 stars)","text: Popped in again to Mellow Mushroom alongside my companion Justin from Brew Bros. & a handful of our friends Monday afternoon during a bar hop on a day off. \nFirstly, I have to mention that my second visit was primarily driven by a swift reply to my initial Yelp assessment from Jay, the proprietor of Mellow Mushroom.  I was not anticipating any feedback, let alone one returned so rapidly. Appreciation for that. It's wonderful to observe such close care being paid to clientele. This would only yield positive outcomes.\nThe identical draught choice as during the inaugural visit. 48 taps. That's a significant quantity of beer. As articulated in my initial critique, I would relish seeing an increased diversity and a dash of creativity in relation to the draught beer options, however who would protest against such an assortment with at least 40 craft beers on draught? That's a genuine dedication.\nOur mixologist Madison showcased enthusiasm for the brews she was distributing, which in Arizona's burgeoning craft beer scene, is a substantial bonus. Additionally, on this occasion, the meal I requested was served rather promptly from the kitchen. Merely a Mediterranean salad, yet satisfying nonetheless.\nIn conclusion, it's fantastic to observe another craft beer aficionado joining the ranks. It's refreshing to have you in our midst.

I wasn't expecting any reaction, much less a reply so promptly. Kudos for that. It's admirable to witness such meticulous attention being paid to patrons.\nThis could only lead to better things. \nThe same array of draft beers as the previous time. 48 faucets. That's an extensive amount of beer. As mentioned in my previous review, with 48 faucets, I would prefer to see a broader range and a slight sense of innovation regarding the draft beer selection, yet again who would object to a line-up with at least 40 craft beers on tap? That's a solid commitment.\nOur barmaid Madison was excited about the drinks she was offering, which in Arizona's expanding craft beer industry is a substantial advantage. On a different note, during this visit, the dish I ordered was swiftly prepared from the kitchen. Just a Mediterranean salad, but pleasant.\nAltogether, it's pleasing to see another craft beer enthusiast enter the scene. It's good to have you around.

I didn't foresee any answers, let alone a revert so speedily. Kudos for that. It's impressive to see a level of dedication towards customer service.\nThis can only result in positive improvements.\nThe same variety of draft beers as the initial time. 48 spigots. That's a substantial load of beer. As stated in my prior assessment, with 48 spigots, I would delight in seeing a wider array and some inventive flair pertaining to the draft beer choices, but then who would gripe about a spread that includes at least 40 craft beers on tap? That's a true commitment.\nOur bartender Madison was passionate about the beers she was dispensing, which in the escalating craft beer society of Arizona, is a significant advantage. On another aspect, this time the food I requisitioned came out of the kitchen exceptionally fast. Just a Mediterranean salad, but worth mentioning.\nAll in all, it's splendid to welcome another craft beer comrade to the fraternity. Happy to have you present.

I didnt expect any reponse, much less a return so quickly. Respect for that. Great to see to someone paying such close attention to their customers.\nThis can only be a good thing.\nThe same draft selection as the first time around.  48 Handles.  Thats a lot of beer.  As said in my first reiview, with 48 handles I would Love to see more variety and a bit more imagination with respect to the draft beer choices, then again who would complain about a selection w/ at least 40 craft beers on tap?   Thats a real commitment. \nOur bartender Madison was enthusiastic about what she was serving which in Arizona's growing craft beer community is a big plus.  On a another note, this time around the food I ordered made it out of the kitchen rather quickly.

Great Steak & Eggs or Steak sandwhich for $5.99, but it doesn't taste like it was $5.99. Service is always tops and you know a place is good when servers know customers by name. My parents love this place so much they sometimes go 5 plus times a week. Nothing on the menu is breathtaking just your normal family restaurant food. Great prices, fantastic specials, and consistently good services. In a town like Vegas you can't beat that.

Otherwise, you're simply wasting time and acquiring a taxi would be more advantageous.\n\nTo start with, this mode of transportation moves dramatically slow, and I'm in the dark as to the reason.

A handful of individuals transport bags or trunks and hoisting them up and down the steps is an exhaustive task.

An employee was present at the bus stop, guiding folks on how to board the bus (is that regular?). He questioned if I had a pass or the like, and when I said no, he dismissed my right to board! With two dollars in hand, I was puzzled about the issue. He expressed mild disdain and asserted that entry was only allowed if the exact change was at hand, which I did possess.\n\nI can somewhat recognize that several tourists are devoid of sense and that man is probably required in his position, but it got on my nerves.

I was competent in understanding all the placards mounted at the bus stand, along with those on the bus.
label: 1 (2 stars)","text: If you plan on traveling great ranges, utilize the Deuce (i.e. from the Strip to Downtown). Otherwise, you're simply wasting time and acquiring a taxi would be more advantageous.\n\nTo start with, this mode of transportation moves dramatically slow, and I'm in the dark as to the reason. The first time I used it, it coincided with heavy rush hour; consequently, I made allowances for the bus operative. But come the next time, with no signs of traffic around, we persisted at the same speed.\n\nThe entire duplex setup is bothersome. A handful of individuals transport bags or trunks and hoisting them up and down the steps is an exhaustive task. Furthermore, if the bus is overrun with passengers (which is often the case), nudging through becomes a challenge. The concept of a double-decker might be viewed as an enjoyable way of discovering the Strip, but the whole bus is inundated with commercials, hampering a proper sight.\n\nOn another note, I was left dissatisfied with the treatment during my boarding attempt. An employee was present at the bus stop, guiding folks on how to board the bus (is that regular?). He questioned if I had a pass or the like, and when I said no, he dismissed my right to board! With two dollars in hand, I was puzzled about the issue. He expressed mild disdain and asserted that entry was only allowed if the exact change was at hand, which I did possess.\n\nI can somewhat recognize that several tourists are devoid of sense and that man is probably required in his position, but it got on my nerves. I was entirely capable of reading all the posters displayed at the station, let alone those splashed across the bus.

Otherwise, it's a waste of time and you'd be better off calling a taxi.\n\nFirst, this thing moves incredibly slow, and I have no idea why. When I first took it, it was during heavy traffic, so I made excuses for the bus driver. But the next time, there was no traffic anywhere, and we still went the same speed.\n\nThe whole double decker set up is annoying. Many people carry bags or luggage and carrying them up and down those stairs takes a lot of effort. Plus, if the bus is crowded (which it usually is), you have to fight to get around everyone else. I can see how having the double decker might be thought of as a fun way to see the Strip, but the whole bus is covered in ads, so you're not getting a very good view.\n\nFinally, I didn't really like the way I was treated when I was trying to board. There was an employee at the bus stop that was instructing people how to get on the bus (is that normal?). He asked if I had a pass or something, and when I said I did not, he told me I couldn't get on! I had two dollars, so I wasn't sure what the problems was. He got slightly indignant and told me I could only board if I had exact change. Which I did.\n\nI can see how a lot of tourists are idiots and that guy probably does need to be there, but it pissed me off. I could read all the signs plastered all over the bus stop, not to mention all over the bus.

Ugh I never had a bad chow fun. But I will go back and try it again. Might be their first day so well see. Beside that it was good. My friend like the sweet and sour chicken but he didn't like how it was prepared. They serve it with the sauce on the side. He preferred it came already sauced up. The price was great about $10 and under. They had a few dishes that were $10 and above. They also do lunch specials until 4pm.

As we made our entry, the personnel were merely lounging with one eventually stand up to serve us. The environment was tidy and the staff were amicable. They showed much patience as we made our meal choices. Being a big aficionado of chow fun (fried chunky rice noodles), I decided to choose that. My comrade opted for sweet and sour chicken. Our dishes were served without much delay. However, my noodles turned out rubbery and difficult to masticate which didn't appeal to me. They were supposed to be soft. I was disappointed having a disappointing chow fun for the first time. Regardless, I am willing to give it another try. Maybe having a flat day considering it was probably their debut. Despite the noodle issue, everything else was enjoyable. My buddy liked the sweet and sour chicken, although he wasn't fond of the preparation style. They served it with sauce separately. He would have preferred if it came pre-sauced. The cost was reasonable, around $10 or less. A few other dishes were over $10. They also offer noon deals up until 4 pm. I am surely going to give it another shot.

I found it pleasing that the family space was wholly distinct from the bar zone. Seating is ample, yet it can become quite congested during game evenings. Furthermore, parking might prove to be inconvenient if your intentions are solely dining and beverages. This detail escaped my attention, causing me to shell out $10 for parking. My drink of choice, the Long Island Iced Tea, turned out to be strong and delightful, precisely how a LIIT should be. My partner opted for the wings, voicing contentment with his choice. My dish was the fish tacos, which I found highly agreeable. The cilantro sauce served alongside was a tad thick and bore more resemblance to ranch, although the salsa was passable. To sum up, my visit was enjoyable and the bartenders were all cordial and observant.

The accompanying cilantro sauce was slightly on the denser side and tasted more like ranch, however, the salsa was decent. Overall, my experience was splendid, and the bar staff were exceedingly cordial and alert.
label: 3 (4 stars)","text: Positioned in the heart of Phoenix, adjacent to the US Airways Center, this establishment features an inviting and high-spirited bar zone. I found it pleasing that the family space was wholly distinct from the bar zone. Seating is ample, yet it can become quite congested during game evenings. Furthermore, parking might prove to be inconvenient if your intentions are solely dining and beverages. This detail escaped my attention, causing me to shell out $10 for parking. My drink of choice, the Long Island Iced Tea, turned out to be strong and delightful, precisely how a LIIT should be. My partner opted for the wings, voicing contentment with his choice. My dish was the fish tacos, which I found highly agreeable. The cilantro sauce served alongside was a tad thick and bore more resemblance to ranch, although the salsa was passable. To sum up, my visit was enjoyable and the bartenders were all cordial and observant.
label: 3 (4 stars)","text: This establishment, featuring an enjoyable and ebullient bar location, makes its home in downtown Phoenix, not far from the US Airways Center. I particularly enjoyed the fact that the family section was entirely cut off from the bar. Seating is generous but the place can become quite packed on game nights. Moreover, if you are coming solely for supper and cocktails, parking might pose some difficulties. I failed to consider this and ended up forking out $10 for parking. I had the Long Island Iced Tea, it was strong and tasted fabulous, just as a LIIT should be. My other half had the wings, expressing satisfaction with his choice. I chose the fish tacos, finding them to be particularly tasty. The accompanying cilantro sauce was a bit rich and tasted more akin to ranch, but the salsa was acceptable. In conclusion, my experience here was delightful and the bartenders were all extremely hospitable and vigilant.

It seemed that the family area was completely separated from the bar area, which I liked. \nThey have plenty of seating but It can get very busy there on a game night. Also, parking can be a problem if you are just there for dinner and drinks. I didn't think of that and ended up paying $10 for parking. \nI ordered the Long Island Iced Tea, it was very potent and tasted great, just the way it the LIIT should taste. My husband got the wings, which I didn't try but he seemed impressed. I got the fish tacos, and they were very good.

text: This location is yummy! You can merge their tonkatsu with countless sesame seeds to suit your taste. I placed an order for the Katsu donburi. They served a massive bowl of rice, egg, and pork tonkatsu. It comes accompanied with miso soup! The miso soup possesses a robust flavor. The bowl is considerably satiating too. They even probed about our culinary joy. I'm convincingly coming back here!

The large swine on the wall accompanied by the vintage lettering attempts to undermine the pervasive and unavoidable airport dining plaza mood.\n\nThe server was amicable, and service was swift.\n\nI asked for a toasted cheese sandwich with tomato broth. The cheese was merely flavorless and the broth was excessively salty as if directly from a can.

Our order took an unreasonably long duration and even further time waiting for our meals in what was a largely uninhabited establishment. Upon expressing my dissatisfaction, the person in charge acted extremely insolently and attempted to assign the blame on us for the delayed order. The logic was flawed, how were we supposed to place our order without the server attending to us? Despite our disagreement he saw it fit to reduce our hefty bill of over $200 by a mere $6. Absurd. Had it been my call, another visit would have never occurred. Regrettably, my relatives opted to dine here once more in the evening. Once again, we waited a considerable amount of time for our meals. Mine was chilly and lacked flavor, as did my children's meals. My spouse's salmon was overcooked and my sister-in-law scarcely tasted her trout before rebuffing it, claiming it was distasteful. The matrimonial soup and loaves were palatable but apart from that, nothing more. My beverage remained untouched through the entirety of my meal, even after my requests for a refill. Below par food, protracted service, and abrasive management. I'll sidestep this establishment if my kin wish to return. Simply not worth the trouble considering the numerous other superb Italian restaurants in close proximity.

On our first visit, we stayed close to 3 hours; the order took an eternity to make and an additional eternity for our dishes to be served, amidst empty surroundings. Upon voicing my annoyance, the supervisor was incredibly disrespectful, accusing us wrongfully of late ordering. The accusation was ludicrous, how can we order if the waitress didn't approach our table? After a heated exchange, he reluctantly discounted $6 from our $200+ check, which was nonsensical. Had it been my decision, I wouldn't have bothered revisiting. Unfortunately, my relations decided on coming back here tonight. Yet again, we waited tediously long for our food. My meal was served cold and without taste, and my children's meals were also served cold. My partner's salmon was overcooked, and my sister-in-law barely tasted her trout before deciding it was revolting. The nuptial broth and bread were the only good aspects of the meal. Despite repeated requests, my drink remained untouched throughout my meal. Terrible food, delayed service, and uncivil managers. I'd happily avoid this place if my family considers returning. Absolutely not value for money when there are countless other fine Italian alternatives.

Our first time there we waited almost 3 hours; not only did the ordering take forever, but the time to serve the food as well in a deserted setting. When I voiced my grievances, the overseer behaved highly arrogantly, wrongfully accusing us of tardiness in ordering. The argument was baseless, how could we possibly order if the server didn't appear? Following a dispute, the overseer reluctantly discounted a miniscule $6 off our massive bill exceeding $200. Preposterous. Given the choice, I would never have considered a second visit, but sadly my kin decided upon a return to this place tonight. Yet again, we were made to wait an undue duration for our food. My food was served cold and tasteless, much like my children's. My husband's salmon was overly burnt, and my sister-in-law denounced her trout as being unacceptably detestable after just one bite. The only redeeming qualities were the matchless soup and bread. Even after I requested, my beverage remained empty throughout the meal. Substandard food, lackadaisical service, and rude staff. I’d choose to forgo this place if my family decides on another visit. It simply doesn't justify its worth when other excellent Italian choices are nearby.

Despite repeated requests, my drink remained untouched throughout my meal. Terrible food, delayed service, and uncivil managers. I'd happily avoid this place if my family considers returning. Absolutely not value for money when there are countless other fine Italian alternatives.
label: 0 (1 star)","text: I've graced this establishment twice and was let down on both accounts, thereby deciding not to make a repeat visit. Our first time there we waited almost 3 hours; not only did the ordering take forever, but the time to serve the food as well in a deserted setting. When I voiced my grievances, the overseer behaved highly arrogantly, wrongfully accusing us of tardiness in ordering. The argument was baseless, how could we possibly order if the server didn't appear? Following a dispute, the overseer reluctantly discounted a miniscule $6 off our massive bill exceeding $200. Preposterous. Given the choice, I would never have considered a second visit, but sadly my kin decided upon a return to this place tonight. Yet again, we were made to wait an undue duration for our food. My food was served cold and tasteless, much like my children's. My husband's salmon was overly burnt, and my sister-in-law denounced her trout as being unacceptably detestable after just one bite. The only redeeming qualities were the matchless soup and bread. Even after I requested, my beverage remained empty throughout the meal. Substandard food, lackadaisical service, and rude staff. I’d choose to forgo this place if my family decides on another visit. It simply doesn't justify its worth when other excellent Italian choices are nearby. 
label: 0 (1 star)","text: I have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. I won't go back. The first time we were there almost 3 hours. It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers. I'll pass on this place if my family decides to go again. Not worth it at all with all the other good Italian options around.

text: The meal was satisfactory and I perceived the serving sizes to be ample. However, I believe the waitstaff was absolutely atrocious. My companion and I entered and two ladies at the register neglected us for some time, stated they would be with us momentarily, continued to disregard us until we finally inquired if we could find our own seating and they merely acknowledged. We proceeded to find a place to sit - and held on for around 15 minutes before someone approached and questioned if we intended to dine there. From that point forward - the customer service did not improve and everything was excessively slow. The server wouldn't even acknowledge us while we were placing our order - almost as if she just did not bother. The provisions certainly do not compensate for the poor treatment. I won't be dining there in the future.

My associate and I made our entrance and two female employees at the desk paid us no mind for a short while, voiced that they would attend to us in a bit, continued to dismiss us until we eventually proposed if we could simply locate our own seats and they gave a nonchalant approval. We then proceeded to seat ourselves - and lingered for the better part of 15 minutes before someone showed up to interrogate if we were planning on feasting there. From this juncture onward - the service remained subpar and everything was unnecessarily languid. The waitress wouldn't even glance at us during our ordering process - looking as if she simply couldn't be bothered. The cuisine does not redeem the dismal customer service in any way.

My acquaintance and I made an appearance and two females behind the bar-counter overlooked us for a few moments, declared their attention would be ours shortly, persisted in their indifference towards us until we had no choice but to assert if we could self-allocate seating and they casually concurred. Subsequently, we established our seating - and held our patience for approximately 15 minutes before somebody showed up asking if we were intending on having our meals there. As the event progressed - the customer care did not elevate in quality and everything felt dragged out. The serving lady refused to even cast a glance in our direction while taking our orders - creating the impression she was detached. The dishes served do scant justice in offsetting the dreadful conduct of the restaurant. I have no intention of repeating my visit.

text: The food was alright and I thought that the portions were a good size. But i think that the service was absolutely terrible. My friend and I walked in and two women at the counter ignored us for a couple minutes, said they would be with us in a second, continued to ignore us until we finally asked if we could just seat ourselves and they just said yes. We then sat ourselves - and waited for about 15 minutes before someone came up and asked if we were going to be eating there. From then on out - the service still was not very good and everything took a long time. The waitress wouldn't even look at us when we were ordering - as if she just did not care. The food definitely does not make up for the terrible service. I will not eat there again.
label: 1 (2 stars)","text: The meal was satisfactory and I perceived the serving sizes to be ample. However, I believe the waitstaff was absolutely atrocious. My companion and I entered and two ladies at the register neglected us for some time, stated they would be with us momentarily, continued to disregard us until we finally inquired if we could find our own seating and they merely acknowledged. We proceeded to find a place to sit - and held on for around 15 minutes before someone approached and questioned if we intended to dine there. From that point forward - the customer service did not improve and everything was excessively slow. The server wouldn't even acknowledge us while we were placing our order - almost as if she just did not bother. The provisions certainly do not compensate for the poor treatment. I won't be dining there in the future.
label: 1 (2 stars)","text: The grub was permissible and I considered the portions to be abundant. Yet, I'm under the impression that the hospitality was utterly detrimental. My associate and I made our entrance and two female employees at the desk paid us no mind for a short while, voiced that they would attend to us in a bit, continued to dismiss us until we eventually proposed if we could simply locate our own seats and they gave a nonchalant approval. We then proceeded to seat ourselves - and lingered for the better part of 15 minutes before someone showed up to interrogate if we were planning on feasting there. From this juncture onward - the service remained subpar and everything was unnecessarily languid. The waitress wouldn't even glance at us during our ordering process - looking as if she simply couldn't be bothered. The cuisine does not redeem the dismal customer service in any way. I shan't be patronizing the place again.
label: 1 (2 stars)","text: The cuisine was acceptable and I was under the impression that the portions were generously proportioned. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that the attendants were downright abysmal. My acquaintance and I made an appearance and two females behind the bar-counter overlooked us for a few moments, declared their attention would be ours shortly, persisted in their indifference towards us until we had no choice but to assert if we could self-allocate seating and they casually concurred. Subsequently, we established our seating - and held our patience for approximately 15 minutes before somebody showed up asking if we were intending on having our meals there. As the event progressed - the customer care did not elevate in quality and everything felt dragged out. The serving lady refused to even cast a glance in our direction while taking our orders - creating the impression she was detached. The dishes served do scant justice in offsetting the dreadful conduct of the restaurant. I have no intention of repeating my visit.

"It's sad that once I logged on to leave a review I see the 5 star review I left one year ago for this place. It used to be my favorite until Saturday night. We went for dinner after drinking downtown around 7pm and was told there was a 30min wait and we'll receive a text once our table was ready. We go to a bar to waste time and 45mins later we receive a text so we return. Once we are seated a woman who said she was part owner tells us that the restaurant is \""very busy tonight and you'll need to be done within a hour\"" and she continues to tell us about the table of 14 that's eating and it being a small kitchen. Mind you they weren't slammed. Our waiter takes our order (still no drinks) and it took so long that we had to ask him after 45 mins where it was. We're now sarcastically thinking, \""Well does the hour start now since we received our food or what?\"" We then ask to speak to the manager about the lack of service and the lady comes back over!!! Ugh! We tell her about our experience and remind her of how rude she was to us and she says there's no way she can compensate us in any way. Smh.

It was once my top choice until the past Saturday evening. After having drinks downtown at around 7pm, we chose to have dinner here only to be informed of a 30-minute delay and that a message would be sent once our seating was prepared. We decided to kill time in a pub and got the message after 45 minutes, prompting us to head back. After settling in, a lady claiming to be the co-owner informed us that the eatery was ""extremely crowded tonight and you'll have to wrap up within 60 minutes"" and she persisted on narrating the story of the group of 14 diners and the limited kitchen space. However, the establishment was not being overflowed with customers. Our server took our order (yet no beverages) and we ended up having to ask him where our food was after 45 minutes. We started to sarcastically query, ""Does the one hour start now since our meal has arrived or what?"" We asked to converse with the supervisor over the absence of quality service and the same lady returned!!! Ugh! We relayed our ordeal and highlighted her discourteous behavior towards us, only for her to claim that there are no means of making up for our experience. Smh. What's truly appalling is that we are locals, so when there's a void of tourists, who do they believe Le Thai is accommodating?

We decided to dine there after we had drinks downtown around 7pm only to get informed of a 30min delay and the promise of a message once our seating was arranged. Therefore, we opted to bide our time at a bar and resumed to the restaurant following a text after 45 minutes. Upon getting settled, a woman claiming to be a partial owner notifies us that the joint is ""immensely occupied tonight and you'll have to be done in 60 minutes"" and continues to discuss the table of 14 that's dining and their modest kitchen. Even though, the place was not packed. The waiter took our request (still no drinks), and we ended up reverting to him post 45 minutes asking for our meal. We began sarcastically wondering, ""Should the clock start now as our meal is served or what?"" We requested to discuss the negligence from their side with the manager and the same woman walks back!!! Aargh! We conveyed our experience and pointed out her impolite behavior, only for her to argue that she had no way of compensating our unfortunate experience. Smh.

text: I dined here on Thursday. I have previously enjoyed meals here, but after this experience, I'm uncertain about returning. Our server approached us for ordering. I mentioned that I was thinking of ordering a salad, while glancing at the menu. She cut me off, stating she had another table to attend to and left. She went away. Our water glasses were topped up. The lady spilt water over one of our designer bags, a Prada. She appeared indifferent and halfheartedly apologized. She left to fetch a towel, not offering us one. Using our serviettes, we mopped up the water from the exterior and interior of the bag. After finally locating and waving down our server to place our order, I asked for a mixed leaf salad with turkey. The salad was mediocre at best, but the turkey looked like cubed, pre-packaged sandwich meat. It was terrible. The bread in the salad was extremely stodgy and rubbery. As we dined, we observed, presumably the manager, busy cleaning the overhead lights at the bar, as patrons were having their meals. Debris was scattered all around, settling on the bar. We could notice the dust from our seat as the bar was elevated. She failed to clean the bar surface but started examining clean glasses. A man was seated enjoying his meal and a glass of water. She still continued to clean the light nearby him. We noticed a bit of friction amongst two employees in the dining area. Not an impressive visit this time.

The waitress approached us to get our requests. I expressed my intention to get a salad, lowering my eyes towards the menu, she hastily mentioned she had another table waiting and departed. She disappeared. Our water glasses were replenished. The girl has accidentally filled a glass over one of our posh handbags, a Prada. She seemed nonchalant and gave a half-hearted apology. She sauntered to get a towel, not offering it to us. We dried the exterior and intererior of the purse using our own napkins. After an extensive search to spot and beckon the waitress to place our orders, I decided on the mixed greens salad with turkey. The salad was only passable, but the turkey looked like it came out of a packaged sandwich meat, cut into squares. It was unpalatable. The bread in the salad was exceedingly hard and stretchy. Whilst having our meal, we witnessed the, possible supervisor, cleaning the bar's ceiling lamps as guests dined below. Dust was accumulating all over the bar. From our seating, we could observe the dust because the bar was elevated. She didn't clean the bar, but instead moved to scrutinize the glasses. A patron was sat there with his meal and a glass of water. Regardless, she went ahead and cleaned the lamp adjacent to him. There seemed to be a bit of a situation between two members of the wait staff in the dining area. This visit wasn't up to the mark.

The attendant came for our order, and when I stated my preference for a salad, peering at the menu, she abruptly excused herself mentioning another table. She retired. The water in our glasses was refilled. The woman spilled water onto one of our branded handbags, a Prada. She seemed unbothered and almost apologized. She departed to retrieve a towel, not extending one to us. We tended to the mess, wiping the purse with our napkins, both inside and outside. I had to seek out and signal to the server to place our order, finally opting for the mixed vegetable salad with turkey. The salad was just about average, but the turkey seemed to be typical supermarket sandwich meat cut into squares. It was dreadful. The bread accompanying the salad was terribly firm and chewy. During our meal, we noticed, what looked like, the manager, cleaning the bar lamps as customers were eating. Dust particles were scattering over the bar. From our vantage point, we could see the dust due to the bar's elevation. She didn't bother to clean the counter, and started inspecting the glasses. One gentleman was enjoying his lunch and a glass of water. She chose to clean the bulb close to him nonetheless. There also appeared to be some tension between two wait staff in the dining section. This visit wasn't noteworthy.

I've witnessed this site double since its inauguration and the delay indeed doesn't justify.

My contending visit on 08/19/12 was roughly 1 hour and 15 minutes. Amidst the subsequent visit on a Sunday, there was merely a singular counter functioning and close to 100 patrons queued. This is an adept location to snatch supper following an extended shopping spree, however, it's not a spot where you can scramble in and out for a rapid nibble. Considering Popeye's is deemed as fast cuisine and not Gordon Ramsey's beef in Las Vegas, I am obliged to assign it a meager rank, because ""who would linger over 60 minutes in a line at a McDonald's or Burger King?"".

Summarily, I grant it a score of 2.5. \n\nYou might likely dedicate hours sifting through their merchandise. They present a broad variety of stuff, including trinkets, furnishings, attire, adornments, vinyls, literature, tableware, and miscellaneous kitchen tools (plus many others). The establishment is brimming with mini ""stalls,"" which I infer are either an approach to categorize goods or are solely owned by an individual/company. It's comparably simple to traverse the store from stall to stall. \n\nDuring the weekends, this place is chaotic. Individuals are crammed in and finding parking becomes challenging. It's too a struggle to uncover reasonably-priced, decent objects. Since the store is so vast, it's quite labor-intensive to take the effort to spot a good deal. Majority of the goods they present appear overrated, with a bulk of them severely deteriorated. Being ""ancient"" does not necessarily equate to an antique. \n\nI would likely revisit, but certainly not during a weekend. I dislike packed places, and this place can definitely get overcrowded. With that said, it's a nice haunt for those who yearn for a value hunt. If you are unbothered with a slight crowd, and are the type who enjoys sorting through stuff for a superb deal, this might be your spot.

Overall, it earns about a 2.5 from me. \n\nOne can potentially allocate several hours here perusing all their goods. They have a diverse assortment of articles on offer, like gems, home decor, garments, ornaments, albums, tomes, kitchenware, and many other assorted culinary implements (and more). The location is teeming with small ""pavilions,"" which I'm guessing is a strategy to assemble similar kinds of articles or are solely owned by one entity. It's rather straightforward to find your way around from one pavilion to another. \n\nOn weekends, it is quite frenzied. Folks are jam-packed and locating parking is a serious struggle. Additionally, to find priced-right, quality items here is hard. As the shop is so massive, it demands a lot of time to go after a decent buy. A lot of merchandise they put forth feels pricey, with many in grave decay. Mere age does not always confer it an antique status. \n\nI might consider visiting again, albeit not on a weekend. I'm not at all enthusiastic about congested spaces, and this spot can get extremely bustling. That being said, it's a fantastic spot for those who are eager for a thrilling bargain chase. If you aren't bothered about a little bit of crowd, and you are the kind who relishes scavenging through stuff for an outstanding deal, this place is likely ideal for you. It's a shame that I lack the requisite persistence for such venues, considering I've witnessed individuals depart with appealing commodities.

Yet, the superior products and excellent deals are markedly infrequent, which is a massive put-off for me. All things considered, my rating is around 2.5. \n\nYou might conceivably invest a couple of hours here inspecting their entire collection. They showcase a myriad of items, spanning accessories, home goods, apparel, embellishments, musical LPs, books, crockery, and other assorted kitchenware (and far more). The venue is packed with diminutive “cubicles"", which I presume were intended to collate similar products, or are singularly owned by one proprietor. It's relatively uncomplicated to find your way around the store from cubicle to cubicle. \n\nOver the weekends, this location is mad. Crowds are stuffed in, and securing parking is notably tough. It’s equally challenging to stumble across fairly tagged, quality goods. Owning to the store's sprawling size, it won't be an exaggeration to say that it’s excessively demanding to find a worthwhile deal. A majority of the goods proposed seem exorbitantly priced, with a significant portion of them displaying notable wear and tear. Simply being ""ancient"" doesn’t invariably imply it's an antique. \n\nI might possibly consider popping in again, just not on a weekend though. I'm not keen on sprawling crowds, and this place can unquestionably get excessively thronged. That being so, this is a choice location for those who have a penchant for a rewarding bargain exploration. If crowds don’t faze you much, and you are the sort who derives pleasure from sifting through objects for an amazing deal, this is potentially your kind of place. I'm genuinely disheartened that I’m a tad too hasty for this sort of location, despite having seen customers depart with attractive acquisitions.

text: Sleep Poet Antique Mall is big, and they have a lot of different kind of things.  However, the great items and great bargains appear to be few and far between, which is a huge turn-off for me.  Overall, I give it about a 2.5.\n\nYou could spend probably hours here looking at all their wares.  They offer a wide selection of items, from jewelry, furniture, clothes, decorations, records, books, dishes, and other random kitchen items (and much, much more).

It's fairly easy to navigate your way around the store from booth to booth.\n\nOn the weekends, this place is crazy.  People are packed in here, and parking becomes quite difficult.  It is also difficult to find reasonably-priced, good items here.  Because the store is so large, it's quite time-consuming to take the time to find a good bargain.  Most of the wares they offer seem overpriced, with many of them in serious disrepair.

I am not a fan of large crowds, and this place can definitely get very crowded.  That being said, this a great place for people who long for a good bargain hunt.  If you don't mind a bit of a crowd, and you are the sort of person who loves to wade through things for an awesome bargain, this is probably the place for you.  I'm definitely sad that I am far too impatient for this type of place, because I've seen people walk away with some nice stuff.
label: 1 (2 stars)","text: Slumber Bard Vintage Fair is sizable, and possess a vast amount of distinct items. However, the impressive goods and deals seem to be sparse, which hugely discourages me. Summarily, I grant it a score of 2.5. \n\nYou might likely dedicate hours sifting through their merchandise. They present a broad variety of stuff, including trinkets, furnishings, attire, adornments, vinyls, literature, tableware, and miscellaneous kitchen tools (plus many others). The establishment is brimming with mini ""stalls,"" which I infer are either an approach to categorize goods or are solely owned by an individual/company. It's comparably simple to traverse the store from stall to stall. \n\nDuring the weekends, this place is chaotic. Individuals are crammed in and finding parking becomes challenging. It's too a struggle to uncover reasonably-priced, decent objects. Since the store is so vast, it's quite labor-intensive to take the effort to spot a good deal. Majority of the goods they present appear overrated, with a bulk of them severely deteriorated. Being ""ancient"" does not necessarily equate to an antique. \n\nI would likely revisit, but certainly not during a weekend. I dislike packed places, and this place can definitely get overcrowded. With that said, it's a nice haunt for those who yearn for a value hunt. If you are unbothered with a slight crowd, and are the type who enjoys sorting through stuff for a superb deal, this might be your spot. I'm definitely saddened that I lack patience for such locations, even though I've observed people leave with desirable items.
label: 1 (2 stars)","text: Rest Writer Relic Market is expansive, and they stock an abundance of various categories of stuff. However, the superlative articles and value buys seem to be scarce, a major deterrent for me. Overall, it earns about a 2.5 from me. \n\nOne can potentially allocate several hours here perusing all their goods. They have a diverse assortment of articles on offer, like gems, home decor, garments, ornaments, albums, tomes, kitchenware, and many other assorted culinary implements (and more). The location is teeming with small ""pavilions,"" which I'm guessing is a strategy to assemble similar kinds of articles or are solely owned by one entity. It's rather straightforward to find your way around from one pavilion to another. \n\nOn weekends, it is quite frenzied. Folks are jam-packed and locating parking is a serious struggle. Additionally, to find priced-right, quality items here is hard. As the shop is so massive, it demands a lot of time to go after a decent buy. A lot of merchandise they put forth feels pricey, with many in grave decay. Mere age does not always confer it an antique status. \n\nI might consider visiting again, albeit not on a weekend. I'm not at all enthusiastic about congested spaces, and this spot can get extremely bustling. That being said, it's a fantastic spot for those who are eager for a thrilling bargain chase. If you aren't bothered about a little bit of crowd, and you are the kind who relishes scavenging through stuff for an outstanding deal, this place is likely ideal for you. It's a shame that I lack the requisite persistence for such venues, considering I've witnessed individuals depart with appealing commodities.
label: 1 (2 stars)","text: Rest Rhymester Curiosity Shop is vast, and they store a broad spectrum of varied things. Yet, the superior products and excellent deals are markedly infrequent, which is a massive put-off for me. All things considered, my rating is around 2.5. \n\nYou might conceivably invest a couple of hours here inspecting their entire collection. They showcase a myriad of items, spanning accessories, home goods, apparel, embellishments, musical LPs, books, crockery, and other assorted kitchenware (and far more). The venue is packed with diminutive “cubicles"", which I presume were intended to collate similar products, or are singularly owned by one proprietor. It's relatively uncomplicated to find your way around the store from cubicle to cubicle. \n\nOver the weekends, this location is mad. Crowds are stuffed in, and securing parking is notably tough. It’s equally challenging to stumble across fairly tagged, quality goods. Owning to the store's sprawling size, it won't be an exaggeration to say that it’s excessively demanding to find a worthwhile deal. A majority of the goods proposed seem exorbitantly priced, with a significant portion of them displaying notable wear and tear. Simply being ""ancient"" doesn’t invariably imply it's an antique. \n\nI might possibly consider popping in again, just not on a weekend though. I'm not keen on sprawling crowds, and this place can unquestionably get excessively thronged. That being so, this is a choice location for those who have a penchant for a rewarding bargain exploration. If crowds don’t faze you much, and you are the sort who derives pleasure from sifting through objects for an amazing deal, this is potentially your kind of place. I'm genuinely disheartened that I’m a tad too hasty for this sort of location, despite having seen customers depart with attractive acquisitions.

A quarter hour later, I receive beef scarlet curry with basil scattered all around the wretched dish. I return it without pronouncing an apology... not even a smile. In fact, I had not perceived a smile since my entrance. Service with a grin? Not in sight. Crappy service, zero grin. Coming to the food... Okay fine. Doesn't matter. So during my initial encounter here: Crappy service. Cluttered guest area. Absence of smiles (seems they dislike guests). And the food was just so-so. Rough day on the job? Nah pal... they overstepped too many occupational norms. I'm departing! No doubt, I won't be coming back.

Fine.  I go to the bar and wait 5 minutes to get attention.  Meanwhile i witnessed about 5 dishes getting cold in the window waiting to get picked up.  I looked around and there were more than enough employees but they all looked like chickens with their heads cut off. \n\nI order beef red curry with no basil or mint leaf. 15 min later I get beef red curry with basil all over the sumbitch.  I returned it with no apology...not even a smile.  In fact, I didn't catch a smile since I had walked in.  Service with a smile?  Nuh uh. Shitty service, no smile.\n\nNow for the food...eh.  Yeah.  Whatevs.  \n\nSo...my first time here:\nShitty service\nMessy dining room\nNo smiles (like they didn't want customers)\nAnd the food was just ok\n\nBad day at the office?  Naw man...they broke too many industry rules.  I'm out!  And i definitely ain't coming back.

Undeniably, it's a reasonably crowded time to contact, but it's not exceptional. Despite being open to the idea of waiting for 15-25 minutes on a Friday evening, I'm not in favor of a 50-minute wait. By that juncture, you're worn out from the irritation of waiting. \n\nOn the whole, Green Cab falls short of expectations.

With Green Cab, there's no certainty regarding their arrival time. \n\nI've equally had a tough time making payments on multiple occasions. A few of the cab drivers relish the old ""my machine is faulty"" narrative when you attempt to make payments through credit cards, while some assert they do not possess any change for your $20 bill. Being a cab driver, your one and only job is to drive, entertain credit card payments, and be capable of providing small change.

Instead of putting your call on standby, Green Cab redirects calls towards a busy signal, leaving you very much out of luck when it comes to following up during rush hours.\n\nBarring these issues, Green Cab is stupendous. \n\nIn the end, I'd stay loyal to Union Cab. You *might* end up shelling out more, but the service compensates for it. Moreover, the drivers are far more engaging.

Perhaps a hamburger with these seasonings and garnishes would also succeed. \n\nAdding another recommendation, I noticed the proprietor felt the need to counter. When you react in that manner, it seems negative and gives your restaurant a poor image. Nothing is improper about having fervor, but I'd counter in a slightly different manner.

When such a reaction is given, it seems negative and causes your food joint to look poor. Passion isn't erroneous, but I'd respond in a slightly distinct manner.

Alas, they're applying dine-in costs for a fast-food, self-serve atmosphere. \n\nThe dishes were satisfactory, but two kebab meals and a drink, that you have to pour yourself costed around $28. Wait a minute, now that I contemplate, one of our selections was a combo and we never received the onion rings (only alternative because they were out of fries). \n\nFor my liking, the melody was somewhat loud. The menu too felt a little too vast and illustrations, as someone else indicated would be a significant bonus. A Mediterranean/Indian joint that cooks up commendable hamburgers could work, but maybe push them a shade more. Maybe a patty with these particular flavorings and toppings could also succeed. \n\nOne more suggestion, I noticed it necessary for the owner to revert. When you react in such a fashion, it appears negative and portrays your restaurant in bad light. There's no harm in being ardent, but I'd respond in a slightly modified manner.

label: 2 (3 stars)","text: I believe this establishment is experiencing some sort of identity confusion. It oscillates between being a quick service eatery or a formal dining setup, but regrettably if sets full service dining rates for a quick service, self-serve setting. \n\nThe meals were acceptable, but two kebab meals and a beverage which you have to fetch on your own totaled nearly $28. Hold on, upon reflection, one of the meals was a mix and we never received the onion rings (only option due to depletion of fries). \n\nTo my taste, the music was somewhat excessively loud. I also felt the menu was somewhat large and images, as someone else pointed out, would be a massive benefit. A Mediterranean/Indian establishment that sells good hamburgers might be successful, but you might want to promote them slightly more. Perhaps a hamburger with these seasonings and garnishes would also succeed. \n\nAdding another recommendation, I noticed the proprietor felt the need to counter. When you react in that manner, it seems negative and gives your restaurant a poor image. Nothing is improper about having fervor, but I'd counter in a slightly different manner. Something along the lines of ""I regret that your experience with us didn't live up to your hopes. We will consider your feedback as we constantly work to improve our restaurant's dining experience."" \n\nI'm a small businesses enthusiast and wish this one flourishes, but there are numerous spots in the city to enjoy good kebabs and Indian food.

label: 2 (3 stars)","text: I suspect this location is enduring a form of identity predicament. It's either a rapid service cafe or a dine-in restaurant. Regrettably, though, they're levying dine-in pricing for a rapid service, self-serve ambiance. \n\nThe cuisine was palatable, but two skewer meals and a refreshment, that you need to fetch yourself was almost $28. On second thought, now that I consider, one of the orders was a combination and we never got the onion rings (sole selection cause of shortage of fries). \n\nTo my preference, the tunes were a trifle loud. The menu also seemed somewhat oversize and photographs, as someone else pointed out would be immensely helpful. A mediterranean/Indian eatery that dishes out excellent hamburgers might just succeed, but perhaps focus on promoting them a bit more. Maybe a burger with these flavors and toppings could also succeed. \n\nAn additional suggestion, I saw that the business owner deemed it essential to reply. When such a reaction is given, it seems negative and causes your food joint to look poor. Passion isn't erroneous, but I'd respond in a slightly distinct manner. Perhaps something like: ""I apologize that your experience with us fell short of your expectations. We will accept your critique as we relentlessly make efforts to enhance our restaurant's dining experience."" \n\nI'm an enthusiast of small corporations and hope this one thrives, but there are quite a few places in the city to find good skewers and Indian food.

label: 2 (3 stars)","text: I have a feeling this spot is undergoing an identity dilemma of sorts. It's sandwiched between being a fast-food joint or a dine-in establishment. Alas, they're applying dine-in costs for a fast-food, self-serve atmosphere. \n\nThe dishes were satisfactory, but two kebab meals and a drink, that you have to pour yourself costed around $28. Wait a minute, now that I contemplate, one of our selections was a combo and we never received the onion rings (only alternative because they were out of fries). \n\nFor my liking, the melody was somewhat loud. The menu too felt a little too vast and illustrations, as someone else indicated would be a significant bonus. A Mediterranean/Indian joint that cooks up commendable hamburgers could work, but maybe push them a shade more. Maybe a patty with these particular flavorings and toppings could also succeed. \n\nOne more suggestion, I noticed it necessary for the owner to revert.

I was crushed by the unforeseen developments, though Dr. Harter comforted me and apologized that I was thoroughly unwell to endure any more delay, but assured me I would certainly be able to undergo VBAC at some point. Indeed, I decided to take his advice. I successfully went through a wonderful drug-free VBA2C at Centennial Hills Health Center on 4/1/2014. I couldn't have desired a superlative or more empathetic gynecologist. *Take Note* Due to his fame, it can be challenging to get an appointment with him, and waiting periods can stretch owing to his commitment to delivering babies...extensively! Those are minor nuisances for me, in exchange for a quality physician! :)

I underwent an immediate surgical birth due to critical gestational hypertension, after anticipating a VBAC. I was shattered by the sudden change of things, but Dr. Harter reassured me by saying he deeply regretted it but I was excessively ill to hang on any further, but I certainly have the potential to experience VBAC in future. Well, I chose to follow his suggestion. I had an extraordinary natural VBA2C at Centennial Hills Hospital on 4/1/2014. I could not have wished for an enhanced or more encouraging obstetrician. *Attention* Owing to his prestige, it could be difficult to secure an appointment with him, and the waiting span could be lengthy as he is occupied with childbirths...frequently! Those are trivial irritations to me, in order to acquire a proficient doctor! :)

Well, I opted to heed his counsel. I experienced a fantastic non-medicated VBA2C at Centennial Hills Clinic on 4/1/2014. I couldn’t have sought a superior or more supportive obstetrician. *Be Aware* Due to his credit, it might be strenuous to secure a meeting with him, and delay could be extended as he’s engaged in facilitating deliveries...plenteously! Those are petty disruptions for me to procure an efficient doctor! :)

text: Dr. Harter is an absolutely amazing and caring doctor.  He has been my OB since my daughter was born in 2009. I had an emergency c-section due to severe preeclampsia, after planning a VBAC. I was devastated by the turn of events, but Dr. Harter held my hand and told me he was very sorry but I was too sick to wait any longer, but I could definitely have a VBAC someday. Well, I decided to take him up on it. I had an amazing unmedicated VBA2C at Centennial Hills Hospital on 4/1/2014. I could not have asked for a better or more supportive OB. *Note*Due to his popularity, it can be hard to get in to see him, and wait times can be long because he's delivering babies...a lot! Those are small inconveniences to me, to get a good doctor!  :)
