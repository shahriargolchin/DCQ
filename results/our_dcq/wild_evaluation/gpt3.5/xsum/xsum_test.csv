"Sarah Johnson was one of 21 women heading to Liverpool when their minibus was hit by a lorry on the M62.
Her friend Bethany Jones, 18, was killed while Ms Johnson and several others were badly hurt.
Minibus driver James Johnson was jailed for more than six years for causing Bethany's death, in April 2013.
Ms Johnson, who broke her shoulder, back and pelvis, said the help she received from a charity while in hospital led her to want to support others.
Speaking publicly for the first time about the crash, Ms Johnson described how everyone was ""excited and giddy"" for the hen party.
""To me the impact was just a massive explosion,"" she said.  ""I thought the bus had blown up.
""I remember the bus dropping on its side. The next thing, I woke up on the roadside so I'd actually come out of the window.""
Ms Johnson was taken to Leeds General Infirmary where she, along with Bethany's sister Amy Firth, underwent major surgery and spent time in intensive care.
Whilst she was there she got support from charity Day One, which helps victims of major trauma.
She said: ""It's absolutely fantastic.
""It supports people by giving benefit advice, legal advice and peer support such as me and Amy, who have been in similar situations and who are now helping other people who've suffered from major trauma.""
Ms Johnson said the crash had made her realise how lucky she had been.
""Beth can't complain, she's not here,"" she added.  ""We just have to be grateful for what we've got.""",A woman who was seriously hurt in a fatal hen party motorway crash is now helping other major trauma victims rebuild their lives.,34363226,summary: A woman who was seriously hurt in a fatal hen party motorway crash is now helping other major trauma victims rebuild their lives.,"A)

"A total of 1,400 tickets have sold out for the opening weekend at Bramall Hall in Stockport, Greater Manchester after renovation work began in 2014.
Stained glass windows and ceilings have been restored, while the public will be able to visit the dining room and butler's pantry for the first time.
Councillor Kate Butler, from Stockport Council, called it the ""jewel in the crown"" of the town's heritage.
The manor dates back to the reign of William the Conqueror when he bestowed the lands upon one of his followers, Hamon de Masci, who became the first Baron of Dunham Massey.
Since then the estate has been under the ownership of just three families: the Davenports, De Bromales and Nevills.
In 1936, the timber-framed hall and its surrounding parkland was handed over to the local council.
The transformation followed a £1.6m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and £400,000 in council funding.",A Tudor manor house has reopened following a £2.2m makeover.,36914724,summary: A Tudor manor house has reopened following a £2.2m makeover.,"A)

"Two-year-old Lane Thomas Graves had been playing in the sand near the resort's Seven Seas Lagoon when he was dragged underwater by the creature.
His parents and older sister had been visiting the Grand Floridian resort in June 2016 from the state of Nebraska.
The lighthouse has been installed near to where the attack occurred.
Wildlife officials classified the killing as a predatory attack, saying the boy did nothing to provoke the alligator.
""He was in the water not more than ankle deep,"" the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said in a report, describing how the boy had been gathering water for a sandcastle.
His father, Matt Graves, jumped in the water to try to pry open the creature's mouth, but ""the alligator thrashed and broke Matt's grasp and went under the water,"" according to the report.
A Disney spokesperson said they hoped the monument would spread awareness for the Lane Thomas Foundation, which also uses the lighthouse as its logo.
Who is liable for alligator boy's death?
""The lighthouse sculpture has been installed to help spread awareness of the Lane Thomas Foundation, which was established to provide assistance and support to families whose children need organ transplants,"" Walt Disney World said in a statement.
After the death, Disney was criticised for not having posted signs warning of the danger along the man-made lagoon, which borders Magic Kingdom.
Public notices have now been added to the area, Florida media report.

The Scotland head coach's side sit second bottom of Group F ahead of the game at Hampden Park on 26 March.
""We must win that game,"" he said. ""There is no getting away from that.""
But Strachan did not wish to consider what a defeat would mean for his own future and said: ""Whatever happens after that, we will look at that.""
The 60-year-old, who has been in charge since 2013, signed a new two-year contract in October 2015.
Following successive 3-0 defeats away to Slovakia and England, he took time to consider his position but decided in November to carry on after receiving the backing of the Scottish Football Association board.
As he announced his squad for the 22 March warm-up friendly against Canada, followed by the qualifier against Slovenia, Strachan underlined his belief that the Scots could still reach the 2018 finals in Russia.
""If we win that game, we will only be one point behind Slovenia, who are in second at the moment,"" he said.
Strachan, whose side lie fifth with four points from four matches, insisted he had ""no idea"" how many points they might require from their final six matches to qualify, while admitting that the Scots could not afford further setbacks.
""But we are looking forward to that challenge and I think the fans will be looking forward to that challenge of going to a game that you must win,"" he said.
""So, together, we can make it a right good night for us.
""The fans have always given us support, but we really need it on that night.
""The guys will be prepared, the fans will be prepared and we are looking to put in a right good performance.""
Strachan will again field questions about his future should Scotland fall short.
""I think fans, players, anybody who really wants us to do well, will be wishing us luck and dealing with anything after the game,"" he added.
""Everyone who wants to see us go to the World Cup will be backing us to win this game.
""The most important thing is three points and enjoying the build-up, which we will be doing.
""The best part of my job is coaching and I am looking forward to that and then looking forward to the challenge of the game.""","Scotland must beat Slovenia if they are to resurrect their chances of reaching the World Cup finals, Gordon Strachan has acknowledged.",39258636,"summary: Scotland must beat Slovenia if they are to resurrect their chances of reaching the World Cup finals, Gordon Strachan has acknowledged.","A)

"Clive Weatherhogg's counsel told appeal judges that prosecutors now conceded there had been a miscarriage of justice over the coercion charge.
Appeal judges also agreed that a jury was misdirected over charges relating to the footage sent to relatives.
Mr Weatherhogg, 43, was jailed last May after being found guilty by a jury.
It is understood he will now be released from prison.
Sheriff George Way had remitted the case from Dundee Sheriff Court to the High Court in Edinburgh to be dealt with because of its greater sentencing powers.
Defence counsel Shelagh McCall QC told the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh that the Crown conceded there was insufficient evidence to prove lack of consent on the coercion charge.
The Lord Justice Clerk, Lady Dorrian, who heard the appeal with Lady Paton and Lord Turnbull, said: ""We are satisfied the concession is well made.""
Lord Turnbull said that information conveyed to the court seemed to show that even at an earlier preparatory marking stage in the case there were concerns over a lack of corroboration.
Lady Dorrian said the appeal judges were also satisfied that misdirections given to jurors by Sheriff Way over the charges relating to the footage sent to relatives were ""material and constituted a miscarriage of justice"".
Mr Weatherhogg, of Guthrie, near Forfar, Angus, had denied the charges during the trial, but admitted a separate charge of uploading the film to the internet.
He was jailed for four-and-years by Lady Wolffe with an additional 18 months for the charge he admitted.
The appeal hearing was told that Mr Weatherhogg had been in custody since March last year and had served the 18 month sentence, taking into account early release provisions.","A man jailed for six years for coercing a woman into having sex with a stranger and sending ""revenge porn"" to her family has had the convictions quashed.",38839837,"summary: A man jailed for six years for coercing a woman into having sex with a stranger and sending ""revenge porn"" to her family has had the convictions quashed.","A)

"The Sky Blues currently play in Coventry's Ricoh Arena but had a long dispute with the stadium's previous owners.
The council said the club wanted to meet to understand how it would deal with a planning application.
The club said it was not commenting ""at this stage"".
The club's owners, Sisu, have been involved in a long-running stand off with the previous operators of the Ricoh that saw the Sky Blues play the 2013/14 season in Northampton.
The arena is now owned by Premiership rugby team Wasps.
In a statement, Rugby Borough Council said its leader and the council's executive director and head of planning had met with Coventry City in March.
""The club requested the meeting to understand how the council would deal with any planning application for potential stadium sites in the borough of Rugby,"" it said.
It said the plans would need to be finalised by September to be included in the council's local plan, but added that a site had yet to be identified.
Peter Ward, from Sky Blues Supporters' Consultative Group, said he was pleased to hear that things were ""moving"" with the club's search for a new home.
""It's good that finally there is some evidence things are happening,"" he said.
""As we've heard from the club's directors, there is a need to take control of and have access to all the revenue streams.""
However, he said that fans could find a move out of Coventry difficult - particularly as they only moved from their previous home, Highfield Road, to the Ricoh in 2005.

"Mohammed Ali, of Prescot Road, Liverpool, is accused of attempting to possess a chemical weapon.
The father of two, 31, has denied the charge at the Old Bailey in London.
Using an online alias, Ali allegedly tried to order 500mg of the deadly toxin, the jury was told, which would have been enough to kill 1,400 people.
As ""Weirdos 0000"", Ali contacted a man on the black market and placed an order for the ricin, the court heard.
He went on to negotiate the deal in encrypted exchanges unaware the United States-based 'dealer' was actually an FBI agent who alerted the British authorities.
On 10 February, he took delivery of a toy car with ""special batteries"" at the home he shared with his wife and two young sons.
But instead of ricin, the five concealed packets contained a harmless powder and Ali was arrested.
The court has been told that the Bolton-born computer software programmer has displayed many traits of Asperger's syndrome.
Under cross-examination, defence clinical psychologist Alison Beck said: ""I think that so far as I understand it, Mr Ali was motivated with pushing the boundaries of what was possible with the technology.

"Bernard Hender, 19, and Doug McTavish, 39, died in the blaze above a funeral director's office in Llanrwst, Conwy county, in October 2014.
The Abergele inquest is examining if a Hotpoint dryer caused the fire.
On Thursday, a fire engineer told the hearing there was ""no compelling evidence"" it started in the dryer but he could not rule it out.
Clifford Christie, a member of the Institute of Fire Engineers, was asked to look into the cause of the fire by domestic appliance company Whirlpool.
Giving evidence on the second day of the hearing, he said the dryer was ""severely damaged"" by fire but some components on the machine were intact.
Mr Christie said he was ""satisfied"" it had not started in the timer, the motor or the drum, and there was no accumulation of lint in the machine.
But he said he could not rule out that it started in the machine's starter switch, which was not recovered following the blaze.
He also told the hearing it was possible there was a fault in an iron kept in the same room.
He said evidence given to the inquest on Wednesday that the iron was switched off might have been ""mistaken"".
On Wednesday, a tenant who lived in the flat spoke of surviving the fire.
Garry Lloyd Jones, 50, told the inquest: ""I just remember walking down the corridor to see what was going on and seeing flames coming out of the tumble dryer.
""I went down to the living area and went to the kitchen and there was nothing there but when I looked out of the kitchen window I could see an orange glow.""
Notices had previously been issued by Whirlpool telling customers to unplug Hotpoint, Creda and Indesit models manufactured between 2004 and 2015 after a potential fire risk was identified.

"According to three separate analyses, a flood of automated comments to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was detected over the weekend.
More than 400,000 comments with remarkably similar wording have been detected in recent days.
Net neutrality proponents argue that all internet traffic should be equal.
This means that no content provider should be able to, for example, charge more for faster access to certain data.
One expert described bot activity as a new form of protest.
""Someone has gone out of their way to make these seem like real submissions,"" wrote Chris Sinchok in a blog post about the apparently automated activity.
Having downloaded the comments and associated data, Mr Sinchok noticed that the names and email addresses associated with thousands of them also turned up in lists of personal data stolen from websites.
He told the BBC that this suggested someone might be using information collected from breached databases to make the submissions look more authentic.
""It really seems like this is getting pooled from some place in an automated fashion and it's coming in at unreasonable rates,"" he said.
He added that the uniformity of the data was also a possible giveaway.
For example, many comments are essentially identical save for the occasional, small difference - such as the exact same sentence appearing in multiple comments, but with different letters capitalised each time.
And the rate at which comments were posted also seemed suspicious, starting and stopping in bursts, he added.
Other watchers, including a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and another at Harvard University, have also tracked a boom in apparently automated activity directed at the site in recent days.
Earlier this month, the FCC said it had been targeted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that led to downtime for the comments system.
This followed a television appearance by comedian John Oliver in which he urged people to post comments against the proposals on the FCC's website.
""Net neutrality is such a hot-button issue and it's one of the few examples of online activism that's actually amounted to something,"" noted Prof Phil Howard at the Oxford Internet Institute.
He cited the 2014 online protests, after which President Obama stepped in to recommend that the FCC drop earlier proposals to curtail net neutrality.
""This is how people protest these days,"" said Prof Howard, referring to the apparently automated comments.
He also pointed out that a growing number of people had the necessary programming skills to do it.

"Schools are asked to create a dedicated page on their school website and send the web address (or URL) to schoolreport@bbc.co.uk and we will link to it from the map of participating schools.
You can use the official School Report graphics, which can be found at the foot of this page.
Then, on School Report News Day on 16 March 2017, schools can upload their reports to their websites.
Here are some frequently asked questions and answers about setting up web pages.
If you're not technically minded, don't worry! The best thing to do is to speak early on to your school's IT department or the people who look after the school website.
You need to create a dedicated School Report web page on the school website so that people can find the students' work. It has to be accessible to the public, so don't use internal websites (or intranets) or pages that need a password.
Until your pupils' reports are ready, the page should contain a ""holding"" or ""come back later"" message. You can copy and paste this:
Students from this school will be making the news for real on 16 March 2017 as they take part in BBC News School Report. We aim to publish the news by 1600 GMT on News Day, so please save this page as a favourite and return to it later.
Have a click through to examples from our School Report map if you want an idea of how other schools have gone about it.
Once the page is live, email the web address (URL) to the School Report team via schoolreport@bbc.co.uk so we can link to your webpage.
As soon as possible! It saves a lot of hassle in the busy run-up to News Day when you and the School Reporters would probably rather be focusing on getting great interviews than sorting out technical issues.
As soon as your page is ready, the School Report team can link to your website from the map of participating schools. - as long as both pieces of School Report paperwork have been returned!
Once live, some schools use the page to reflect what's happening in the build-up to the News Day, for example adding team photos and encouraging pupils to post news reporting ideas.
No. It is important to create a dedicated web page, so the BBC can link directly to the students' journalistic work. The fewer the clicks, the more likely you are to retain the audience.
Also, after the News Day, the homepage of a school website will inevitably change, but creating a dedicated page means there is a permanent record of their work.
Yes. If your school has participated in School Report in previous years, you can use the existing web page, but remember to label it clearly.
Remember, you risk losing people's attention if they think your web page is out of date. A simple message at the top of the page can be helpful, such as the example mentioned above.
If you can't publish School Report content on your school website, all is not lost!
You could look at hosting stories on another website that you consider appropriate and that is in line with your school's policy. See if your local council or academy sponsor could help host your content.
Some schools have used websites such as Makewaves, a website designed to host video and audio material for educational purposes.
You could create a web page using a number of different programmes, with many people using software such as Microsoft Expression or Adobe Dreamweaver.
If you do use a site other than your school site, check the terms and conditions to make sure it is suitable for 11 to 16-year-olds and that there are no advertisements on the site.
The golden rule is to use first names only. For child protection reasons, the BBC cannot link to a page which contains the surnames of anyone younger than 18. This also applies to blog entries and comments posted on the page.
Refer to the School Report guidelines on staying safe and legal which highlight some of the issues anyone should consider when publishing content which features children. This page also offers guidance about media law issues such as copyright, libel and contempt of court as well as editorial issues such as taste and decency.
Be aware that the BBC website is very popular. By virtue of a link from the BBC, students will have a large audience but people will also be able to access other pages on the school website.
At the bottom of this page, there are some School Report graphics you can use on your dedicated web page. However, they can only be used by schools who have completed their paperwork, and within the context of the project.
It is also a good idea to incorporate the design of your school website to create a uniform look.
It is best to avoid a design which relies on large pictures as it will make pages slow to download and could put off potential viewers. However, you might like to add photographs of students taking part in School Report or the school logo.
Our agreement with the head teacher of every school taking part explicitly states that the school, not the BBC, is responsible for the school website. Teachers need to decide on the most suitable way of hosting content according to their school's social media, internet safety and child protection policies.
For this reason, we are happy to link to school websites which use YouTube (or similar video-sharing websites) to embed content, provided the school website complies with our guidelines in all other ways. We will not, however, link directly to YouTube.
Some schools have used websites such as Makewaves, a website designed to host video and audio material for educational purposes.
Providing the school website complies with our guidelines in all other ways, we are happy to link to school websites containing links to social media.
Generally though, we do not recommend including links to social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter from your school website, as they are designed to be used by children aged 13 or over. There is a risk of students experiencing cyberbullying via such sites.
If your school website contains an automated Twitter feed, you may want to look into deactivating it or at least monitoring it during the busy time around News Day.
A dedicated page means the audience can find students' work easily and quickly. It also provides a  permanent archive of students' reports and makes it clear that the reports are new and not from previous years. The page can also help avoid any potential child protection issues.

"Her best-known films include 1938's Quai des Brumes (Port of Shadows), in which she starred alongside Jean Gabin.
She also appeared in Carol Reed's The Fallen Idol and opposite Humphrey Bogart in Passage to Marseille.
In a statement, French president Francois Hollande said she ""personified elegance and grace"".
He said: ""Michele Morgan was more than just a gaze. Her legend left its mark on many generations.""
Morgan's Cannes award came in 1946 for her role as a blind woman in La Symphonie Pastorale (Pastoral Symphony).
In later life, she received lifetime achievement accolades at the Venice Film Festival and the Cesar Awards, as well as a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Morgan was considered for the role of Ilsa Lund in Casablanca, but lost out to Ingrid Bergman when film studio RKO refused to loan her to Warner Bros.
Her film career faded with the arrival of the French New Wave in the 1960s, although she continued to work in television and on stage.

"But that requires a very patient man or woman to select the most important periods of play.
Now scientists in Spain are trying to make that work easier by getting a computer to do it.
The technology is being designed to automatically edit a whole game down to the key moments.
The people behind it at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia have been working on it for a few years and have just published 18 pages of exactly how it works.
Arnau Raventos is the lead professor on the project.
He tells Newsbeat they have ""been working with the local television companies in Spain in order to try to make the job easier for the person who manually does the summaries currently.""
Without having to read the full report (we did that for you) - in short - it analyses what are known as key-frames.
So, every part of the match is looked over by the computer to spot tell-tale signs of when something interesting is happening.
That might be lots of players grouped together, lots of zoomed-in action, extra noise from the crowd or the sound of the referee's whistle.
Arnau calls them ""occasions"".
""We want to find specific combinations of moments in a football match. A goal is an occasion.""
We thought of an example: if a defender goes down in the penalty box, everyone groups around them, you'll hear a whistle, there's lots of faces in the shot and a penalty happens. In theory, the technology should capture that.
There is a long way to go though.
The technology could frustrate even the most lukewarm of football fans because it hasn't quite nailed exactly the magic moment - when the goal goes in.
In a test on five matches, the technology detected 70 per cent of the total goals.
""We need to be sincere,"" says Arnau. ""We need to say that at the moment it's not possible to perform a complete automatic summary just yet. It's difficult to detect all the goals.""
""However, we think it's very easy to discard those moments that are not important. For example, the panoramic views. They are easy to detect and to discard them so that already makes the job of the editor easier.""

"The Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list.
At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it.
Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating.
The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower.
The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS.
Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong.
Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard.
What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost.
Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation.
Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors.
It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome.
But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later.
The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny.
Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign.
The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile.
He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people ""did not see the strengths"" of its arguments.
The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a ""je ne regrette rien"" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition.
She has admitted the party failed to communicate what they were standing for. It will now hold a series of meetings across Wales as it tries to rally members for an election that it'll be able to fight unshackled of being in coalition government which was clearly a burden to many of them.",Another election is probably the last thing the public want to hear about after what we've just gone through but that's exactly what the parties at the assembly are gearing up for next year.,32713124,summary: Another election is probably the last thing the public want to hear about after what we've just gone through but that's exactly what the parties at the assembly are gearing up for next year.,"A)

"In a speech he said, given the effects of the referendum vote, the government had to be ""realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of the decade"".
The target had been the chancellor's most prized goal and had been driving austerity measures in previous budgets.
But he said the economy is showing ""clear signs"" of shock following the vote to leave the European Union.
Giving a speech in Manchester, Mr Osborne said: ""The referendum is expected to produce a significant negative economic shock to our economy. How we respond will determine the impact on jobs and growth.
""We must provide fiscal credibility, continuing to be tough on the deficit while being realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of the decade.""
Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell welcomed the move, saying: ""Sadly the vote last Thursday for Brexit has only brought forward what was inevitable.
""The Chancellor had already dropped his other fiscal rules on welfare and debt at the Budget in March, and according to many economists he was expected to be forced to drop this one too.""
BBC business editor Kamal Ahmed says that the target was heading for the ""Treasury shredding machine"" following a speech from Home Secretary Theresa May yesterday.
In a speech launching her bid to become prime minister she said ""we should no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by the end of the parliament"".
Kamal says that Mr Osborne has now followed suit.
Nevertheless, the Treasury insists that it still wants to balance the books and ""fix the finances"".
Mr Osborne first committed himself to returning the national finances to surplus by 2020 at the Conservative Party conference in 2013 and it became policy in the July budget of 2015.
But there have been questions ever since over whether that target could be met.
Even before the referendum vote he only had ""a slightly better than 50/50 chance"" of making the target said Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
But the uncertainty caused by the Leave vote could hold back the economy and make creating a surplus even more difficult.
""Having voted for Brexit last week, the economy is clearly going to go into a downswing, that might be a full-blown recession, that might just be very very low growth,"" said Paul Johnson the director of the IFS.
It is sometimes easy in these incredible political times to forget that for most people ""it's the economy, stupid"" still holds true.
For the UK economy, one of the most important passages of Theresa May's speech yesterday was when she signalled that George Osborne's ""fiscal rule"" (to produce a budget surplus by 2020) was for the Treasury shredding machine.
""While it is absolutely vital that the government continues with its intention to reduce public spending and cut the budget deficit, we should no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by the end of the parliament,"" Mrs May said.
Now the chancellor has said he agrees, arguing that the government must be ""realistic"" about its fiscal targets and that austerity policies could be eased.
My Treasury sources point out that the ""rule"" can be varied in ""non-normal"" times.
And these are pretty ""non-normal"" times.
The abandonment of the fiscal target suggests the government could borrow more, presumably for investment in infrastructure and to mitigate the need for tax rises and spending cuts, if the economy does take a turn for the worse as some predict.
More from Kamal: Brexit and the easing of austerity
The Tories have been in turmoil since David Cameron announced his intention to resign following the UK's vote in favour on leaving the European Union.
In a shock development on Thursday, Boris Johnson, widely seen as the frontrunner to become prime minister, announced that he would not be running.
The BBC has learned that Justice Secretary Michael Gove is now coming under growing pressure to abandon his bid to become Tory leader.
Sources have told the BBC government ministers are trying to persuade the justice secretary to give way so the party can ""unite"" around Home Secretary Theresa May.
Mr Gove opted to stand after switching his support from Boris Johnson.
In a speech, Mr Gove said his decision to stand to become Conservative leader is driven by ""conviction"" about what is right for the UK not personal ambition.
Three other candidates have put their names forward for the Conservative leadership: Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom, MP Liam Fox and Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb.
The government borrowed Â£74.9bn in the 2015/2016 fiscal year and for the financial year so far - covering April and May - borrowing reached Â£17.9bn, Â£0.2bn higher than the same period a year ago.
It is thought that the government will now raise borrowing, so it can avoid further cuts in spending or raising taxes. It could also borrow to invest in big building projects.
""The problem of course is, you can't borrow forever,""said Paul Johnson from the IFS.
""So we'll have a few more years of more borrowing, but my guess is this is not the end of austerity, actually this means austerity will just go on for longer because we'll probably have the spending cuts and tax rises right through the 2020s to pay for this.""",Chancellor George Osborne has abandoned his target to restore government finances to a surplus by 2020.,36684452,summary: Chancellor George Osborne has abandoned his target to restore government finances to a surplus by 2020.,"A)

"The first of six boxes was unveiled on Tottenham Court Road this week.
The service is free to use although users will be shown adverts as they wait for their phone to charge.
Many of the UK's red telephone boxes have largely fallen into disuse although some are being revived as libraries or being fitted with medical equipment.
The boxes have had a makeover for the project - painted green and fitted with a roof-mounted 86cm solar panel.
Inside there are a variety of charging stations for different models of phone and a screen which shows adverts.
The advertising screen is reinforced to deter vandals and the boxes are maintained daily and locked overnight.
The project was the brainchild of two geography students turned entrepreneurs Harold Craston and Kirsty Kenny.
Both studied at the London School of Economics (LSE) and were interested in finding new ways to use public spaces.
""I lived next to a phone box in my second year at uni and walked past it every day. I thought, 'There are 8,000 of these lying unused in London and we must be able to find a use for them,'"" explained Mr Craston.
The solarbox can charge up to 100 phones a day, offering a 20% battery boost in 10 minutes.
Since launch, about six people per hour use the booth, according to the founder.
Running out of battery is a perennial problem for smartphone users as they become ever more powerful without an equivalent technology leap in battery life.
""On launch day, my phone ran out of battery and I genuinely had to use the box,"" said Mr Craston.
Solarbox won second place in the Mayor of London's Low Carbon Entrepreneur of the Year Award earlier this year and also won the LSE's Emerging Entrepreneur of the Year award.
Five more boxes will be rolled out by April 2015.
Funded by advertising, the founders are keen to make sure users are engaged by ""short, fun and exciting ads showing exclusive content"".

The PSNI has previously said it would support any move to set up such a body.
Lord Alderdice, who is also a former leader of the Alliance Party, said he did not think it would be appropriate for the commission to return now.
Talks will begin next week in Belfast in a bid to resolve the current crisis,  sparked by the murder of ex-IRA man Kevin McGuigan Sr.
Police believe that killing was in retaliation for the murder of former IRA commander Gerard Jock Davison in the Markets area of Belfast in May.
The Ulster Unionists withdrew from the executive after police said Provisional IRA members had a role in the killing.
""The current crisis is of a different order,"" Lord Alderdice told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme.
""Even before the horrible murders of these two men, we were right on the edge of devolution being set aside.
""If somehow or another, magically, the issue of these two murders was taken out of the picture, we would still be in that position of crisis where the assembly, the executive, is about to be suspended or fold because there is no agreement on the governance of Northern Ireland.
""The IMC or any new IMC could not help that problem at all, it did not have a political mandate to try to get people to negotiate on the politics and the governance issue.
""I think it is maybe unwise for people to look back at a form of treatment that worked before and say: 'Oh well the symptoms are the same so the diagnosis is the same'.""",The ex-chair of the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) has said he does not believe bringing it back would solve the latest Stormont crisis.,34152489,summary: The ex-chair of the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) has said he does not believe bringing it back would solve the latest Stormont crisis.,"A)

"The children, who had previously lived in areas controlled by Boko Haram, were held in a military barracks in the north-eastern city of Maiduguri, a UN spokesman told the BBC.
Details of the children's ages and the length of their detention have not been given.
The army has not made any comment.
Human rights groups argue that there is no proper legal process for civilians, including children, who are detained by the army as part of their counter-insurgency operations.
""We fear that there are still kids who are being at least temporarily detained because they are being released from Boko Haram areas by the army but then kept for a while,"" Manuel Fontaine, regional director for the UN Children's fund (Unicef) in Central and West Africa, told Reuters news agency.
Earlier this month, 21 of the more than 200 Chibok schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram two years ago were released and reunited with their families.
Nigeria has been fighting a seven-year insurgency against Boko Haram, with the army retaking much of the territory under the Islamist militants' control in the past 20 months.

"Liberty, headed by Sanjeev Gupta, was first to express an interest in the assets when they were put up for sale.
A spokesman for Liberty told the BBC that the firm had put together a team of advisers and financial backers.
""The formal process is to submit a letter of intent; it amounts to a bid. It will be done on Tuesday,"" he said.
In addition to the Port Talbot factory - the UK's largest steelworks - Tata's remaining assets include sites at Newport, where more than 1,300 people are employed, and Rotherham, which employs 1,200. Tata also has operations at Corby, Shotton and Teesside.
Macquarie, the Australian bank, was advising Liberty on a potential bid, and is considered a potential financial backer of any takeover.
Liberty House started life in the university room of Indian-born founder Sanjeev Gupta.
While a student at Cambridge University in 1992, the budding entrepreneur started what has since become a global steel and commodities business with annual sales of more than £2bn.
With operations in 30 countries, and headquarters in London, Dubai, and Singapore, Mr Gupta's Liberty has also emerged as a possible saviour of Britain's steel industry.
Liberty's focus is on recycling the mountains of scrap metal generated in the UK, rather than the historical method of producing steel in blast furnaces.
Last month, it acquired Tata Steel's plants in Lanarkshire. In recent years, it has reached similar deals for steel plants in Newport and the Black Country.
A management buyout team is also planning to submit a bid under the name Excalibur Steel UK Limited.
It has appointed investment banker Mark Rhydderch-Roberts as a non-executive director. He joins Stuart Wilkie, the head of Tata's United Kingdom strip steel business, and former Alcan senior executive and venture capitalist Roger Maggs, on the board.
The government has promised to support any buyer of the business by taking up to a 25% stake in a new business and making hundreds of millions of pounds of finance available.
Tata has not publicly set a deadline for any deal, but has made it clear it cannot sustain its £1m-a-day losses indefinitely and does not want to prolong the uncertainty for workers and customers.
Tata's Scunthorpe operation, which employs more than 3,000 people, has been sold to investment firm Greybull Capital for a nominal £1.","Liberty House plans to submit a formal bid on Tuesday to buy Tata Steel's UK assets, which include the Port Talbot works employing about 4,000 people.",36189022,"summary: Liberty House plans to submit a formal bid on Tuesday to buy Tata Steel's UK assets, which include the Port Talbot works employing about 4,000 people.","A)

"The ""learning from mistakes league"" rates 120 trusts outstanding or good, 78 with ""significant concerns"" and 32 with a ""poor reporting culture"".
Other measures include legal protection for staff who admit mistakes, and new medical examiners to review deaths.
A patient safety charity welcomed the moves but said it remained ""concerned"".
The first annual ""learning from mistakes league"" uses feedback from staff on their freedom to speak when things go wrong.
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is hosting a ""global patient safety summit"" in London on Wednesday and Thursday, said the changes were a step towards a ""new era of openness"".
He said health services must ""unshackle ourselves from a quick-fix blame culture and acknowledge that sometimes bad mistakes can be made by good people"".
The changes announced by Mr Hunt include:
Peter Walsh, chief executive of patient safety charity Action Against Medical Accidents, welcomed the initiatives but said he remained concerned about the ""woeful inconsistency and often inadequate quality of NHS investigations into serious incidents"".
He said there was ""nothing"" in Mr Hunt's announcement to reassure his organisation that urgent action would be taken to address the quality of local investigations.
James Titcombe, whose son Joshua died after failings in care, said the measures were ""major steps that will help move the NHS towards the kind of true learning culture that other high-risk industries take for granted"".
Labour's shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander said her party supported ""any measures that will improve safety"", but she added: ""On Jeremy Hunt's watch, hospitals are overcrowded, understaffed and facing financial crisis.""","Health trusts in England have been ranked by their ability to learn from mistakes, as part of several changes designed to improve patient safety.",35761011,"summary: Health trusts in England have been ranked by their ability to learn from mistakes, as part of several changes designed to improve patient safety.","A)

"It is not the done thing to interfere in the internal affairs of a member state after all and Britain is still a member state - just about.
EU Council President Donald Tusk has already offered a lesson in what to say when you know you can't say much.
He wrote: ""It was Hitchcock who directed Brexit - first an earthquake and the tension rises.""
That suggests that Mr Tusk has only a hazy knowledge of the works of Hitchcock - but it also hints at an expectation in Brussels that the Brexit debate is about to heat up.
In domestic terms, Mrs May is hoping for a strong, clear and personal mandate to lead the Brexit negotiations on her own terms. And if the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wins he would also claim endorsement for placing his own political priorities at the centre of the talks to come.
But in European terms, that's something of a secondary issue.
The EU Commission's lead negotiator, Michel Barnier, is going to have to deal with whoever is in residence in 10 Downing Street and the strength of the occupant's mandate won't be his concern.
His team have already said that while the announcement doesn't change anything, there's a hope that it will produce a strong leader with strong backing from the people of the UK.
And we can be sure this British election will be watched with even closer attention than usual - not just in Brussels but in the other European capitals where Brexit is going to be a huge issue in the years to come.
First, both Theresa May and all her rivals will have to set out their visions for Brexit in much more detail than we've heard so far.
British voters will demand nothing less.
But in the process, the Barnier team and the governments of France, Germany and the rest will get a feeling for where the British red lines in negotiations really lie.
Any British candidate worth his or her salt will try to leave room for manoeuvre in the talks to come after the election, but it will surely be impossible to campaign without giving away at least some detail.
And of course there are romantics across Europe who hope that the voice of the Remainers will be heard loud and clear in the British debate to come.
The hope that Brexit might be quickly reversed has pretty much faded from the European debate now, but plenty of politicians across the continent will be hoping to hear candidates putting forward the argument for a soft Brexit with the closest possible links to the EU and its single market.
That may be wishful thinking, but there'll be strong support for such voices from many quarters in Europe.
Europe was taken by surprise by Theresa May's announcement, but not taken aback. The EU negotiators have been working hard behind the scenes to prepare their position and their message is that they're ready to negotiate with Britain, no matter who occupies 10 Downing Street.
This was already a busy year for European democracy - the Netherlands has already voted, while France votes for a president at the weekend and will hold National Assembly elections in June.
Germany goes to the polls in September.
But there's an awareness that the UK election will be different precisely because it will play a huge part in shaping the British negotiating position on Brexit.
And, of course, there's also the fascination of the pure political theatre of it all.",The EU has to be measured in its response to Theresa May's election announcement.,39632041,summary: The EU has to be measured in its response to Theresa May's election announcement.,"A)

"The official data prompted the government to upgrade growth forecasts for the second time in a week and to promise no new austerity measures.
Last week, growth for 2014 was up-rated to 3% from 2.1%, but will now be around 4.5%, Ireland's finance minister said.
Michael Noonan said the economy was in ""a catch-up phase... after recession"".
The year-on-year growth of 7.7% was the strongest recorded in Ireland since the early 2000s, Mr Noonan told reporters. By comparison, the eurozone recorded growth of just 0.7% over the same period.
Along with Greece, Spain and Portugal, Ireland was among the eurozone's worst hit economies, with the bursting of its property bubble and soaring unemployment.
The 1.5% quarterly rise beat the 0.5% expected by economists polled in a survey by the Reuters news agency.
Mr Noonan said the faster growth would mean Ireland's budget deficit falling to about 3.5% of GDP this year against a target of 4.8%. That meant 2bn euros of tax rises and spending cuts planned for next year would no longer be needed to reach the EU limit of 3% by the end of 2015, he said.
The economic improvement comes after years of austerity, a bailout from international lenders, and relentless austerity measures.
""At face value, the numbers suggest that the boom is back,"" said Austin Hughes, chief economist at KBC Bank Ireland.
""It shows a clearly improving economy. It's very encouraging to see the improvement in consumption, in construction. So a domestic recovery is taking hold, if a lot less intense that the headline number would suggest,"" he said.","The Republic of Ireland's economy grew 1.5% in the second quarter of the year, figures show, and was up 7.7% on the April-to-June period in 2013.",29252950,"summary: The Republic of Ireland's economy grew 1.5% in the second quarter of the year, figures show, and was up 7.7% on the April-to-June period in 2013.","A)

"President Raul Castro said ""attempts to destroy the revolution"" would fail.
Mr Trump has tightened restrictions on US travel to and business with the communist island.
But the US embassy in Havana, re-opened by former President Barack Obama, is still operating.
Mr Castro was speaking in front of Cuba's national assembly. It was his first public comment on the policy changes Mr Trump announced a month ago.
State-run Cuban media quoted Mr Castro as saying that Mr Trump was using ""old and hostile rhetoric"" and had returned to ""confrontation that roundly failed over 55 years"".
He said: ""We reject the manipulation of the topic of human rights against Cuba, which can be proud of much in this area and does not need to receive lessons from the United States nor anyone.""
Mr Trump anchored his policy rollback in human rights concerns raised by political opponents of Cuba's communist government, many of whom have fled to Miami where Mr Trump announced the changes on 16 June.
Mr Castro continued: ""Cuba and the United States can cooperate and live side by side, respecting their differences. But no one should expect that for this, one should have to make concessions inherent to one's sovereignty and independence.""

He replaces Kieran Harding, who quit last month after Carrick lost seven of their opening nine games.

"They talk of a boy who dressed smartly and worked hard, but who barely said a word during his time at school.
Police officers have said he may have had a personality or developmental disorder, while one relative told ABC News he was ""obviously not well"".
Lanza appears to have kept a low profile throughout his life. US media report that unusually, his high school yearbook of 2010 contained no photograph of him.
""Camera shy"" was the comment by his entry.
Unlike the majority of his peers, Lanza apparently had no Facebook page. His online footprint was minimal. He appears not to have been known to the police.
Adam Lanza lived with his mother in a well-to-do neighbourhood of Newtown, Connecticut. The house is about five miles (8km) from Sandy Hook School, which he attended as a child.
He went on to Newtown High School, but made few friends. His mother pulled him out of the school and taught him at home because she was unhappy with the school district's plan for his education.
His aunt, Marsha Lanza, said that Adam was ""definitely the challenge to the family in that house"".
""Every family has one. I have one. They have one. â€¦ But he was a very bright boy, he was smart,"" she said.
Intelligent but shy and nervous were the most common memories of those who learnt beside him.
Richard Novia, who was head of security at Newtown High School, said it was clear Lanza had ""some disabilities"".
He was protective of his personal space and sometimes appeared to completely withdraw into himself or to ""take flight"", Mr Novia told AP, meaning his mother had to be called in to resolve the problem.
""You had yourself a very scared young boy, who was very nervous around people he could trust or he refused to speak with.""
Mr Novia helped to run a technology club, which Lanza attended, and said he had to keep a close eye on him while the club was using soldering equipment or electrical equipment.
""If that boy would've burned himself, he would not have known it or felt it physically,"" he said.
An inability to respond to sensation, and a difficult in relating to other people, could be an indication of Asperger's Syndrome (a form of autism), say experts.
They stress there is no direct link between the condition and aggression. People with the condition can sometimes struggle to express themselves in socially expected ways, however.
Olivia DeVivo was a student with Lanza in the 10th grade, at about the age of 15. She told the Associated Press he was ""very shy and didn't make an effort to interact with anybody"".
""Now looking back, it's kind of like 'OK, he had all these signs,' but you can't say every shy person would do something like this,"" she said.
A former school bus driver in the town, Marsha Moskowitz, said she remembered the Lanza boys.
""You know the trouble kids, and you figure, 'Pfft, that one's going to be trouble.' But I never would have thought that about them,"" she told the Hartford Courant newspaper.
Marsha Lanza told the Associated Press that Adam had been raised by kind, nurturing parents, who would not have hesitated to seek counselling for their son if he needed it.
The parents divorced in 2009, having separated at least three years earlier. His father, Peter Lanza, moved to Stamford, Connecticut, and recently remarried.
His mother, Nancy, remained in the family home, where it is thought she was killed by her son. She had previously worked in finance, but her divorce settlement left her well off and she stayed at home.
Friends said she was popular and sociable. An acquaintance, Jim Leff, wrote on his blog that she was ""a friend-of-friends who I periodically would briefly bump into, and who always seemed kind-hearted... and, yes, a bit high-strung. But with ample reason, as it turns out.""
Contrary to initial reports, Nancy Lanza never worked as a teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
She was a gun enthusiast who is reported to have taken her sons with her to the shooting range. Adam Lanza used her legally purchased Bushmaster assault rifle to carry out his attack. He was also carrying his mother's two handguns, a Glock pistol and a Sig Sauer. Police found a shotgun in his car.
Adam Lanza's elder brother, 24-year-old Ryan, who was initially named in the media as the suspected gunman, has been helping police with their investigation. US media is reporting that he told them he had had no contact with his brother since 2010.
In a statement issued to the media, Lanza's father said: ""No words can truly express how heartbroken we are.
""We, too, are asking why. Like so many of you, we are saddened and struggling to make sense of what has transpired.""","Former classmates of Adam Lanza, 20, the man identified as the gunman in the Sandy Hook School killings, do not remember much about him.",20738732,"summary: Former classmates of Adam Lanza, 20, the man identified as the gunman in the Sandy Hook School killings, do not remember much about him.","A)

Ten teams - including Renault, Audi and Jaguar - currently take part in the Formula E series, with two new entries to be allocated for 2018-19 subject to the approval of the International Automobile Federation (FIA).
Formula 1 champions Mercedes are considering taking an option to join.
""As our production cars are becoming increasingly electric, our motorsport cars, as Audi's technological spearheads, have to be even more so,"" Stadler added.
Pierre Fillon, president of the Automobile Club de l'Ouest, which organises the Le Mans race, said: ""It was with emotion that we all learned this morning about Audi's decision to withdraw from endurance racing.
""Although prepared for this, we regret the departure of a major figure in endurance racing for a different adventure.""","Audi will not race in next season's World Endurance Championship, which includes the iconic Le Mans 24 Hours race, to concentrate on Formula E.",37782718,"summary: Audi will not race in next season's World Endurance Championship, which includes the iconic Le Mans 24 Hours race, to concentrate on Formula E.","A)

"Giving evidence for the ex-Sunderland winger at Bradford Crown Court, Stacey Flounders said she did not see a future in their relationship.
The 26-year-old is the mother of Mr Johnson's one-year-old daughter.
Mr Johnson, 28, denies two counts of sexual activity with a child.
In the witness box, Miss Flounders described how he had told her ""everything"" about kissing a 15-year-old girl when he returned from a police station after his arrest in March last year.
Asked if he talked about other things, she said: ""The other women that he cheated on me with.""
Miss Flounders was asked by Orlando Pownall QC, defending, how many there were and she said: ""Quite a few.""
When questioned about about the future of her relationship with Mr Johnson, she replied: ""We're just going to remain friends.""
She told the jury she had stayed with him after his arrest ""because he was honest with me and I knew he was telling the truth"".
""We'd just had a daughter. I wanted us to be a family. My head was all over the place. I didn't know what was going on.""
Mr Pownall finished his questions by asking Miss Flounders if she saw any future in ""the relationship that you had"".
She replied: ""Do you mean now? Not at the minute, I don't. No.""
She was asked about messages she exchanged with Mr Johnson on the day of the incident with the girl, and she admitted she suspected him of being unfaithful but had no ""hard and fast evidence"".
She said he first told her he was going to plead guilty around September last year.
Miss Flounders said she had previously exchanged messages with the teenager involved after she recognised her as one of the fans who waited for Mr Johnson after home matches.
She said she even wished the girl happy birthday in 2014.
She added that after his arrest, Mr Johnson told her the girl was aged 16.
Kate Blackwell, QC, prosecuting, went through some of the details of the teenager's account of the incident and asked Miss Flounders whether her partner had told her about each.
Miss Blackwell asked her if he told her the pair had kissed with tongues and about various messages Mr Johnson had exchanged with the girl.
Miss Flounders agreed that he had not told her, although she said he had mentioned he asked for a ""thank you kiss"".
Earlier, Miss Flounders was asked a series of questions about her partner's pubic hair and was asked to examine a photograph.
The teenager involved in the incident has told the jury Mr Johnson was shaved in that area.
Miss Flounders said he would trim the area with scissors, but would not shave.
Mr Johnson began his football career at Middlesbrough before moving to Manchester City and then on to Sunderland in 2012.
He has previously pleaded guilty to one count of sexual activity with a child and one charge of grooming.  These relate to him kissing the girl in his Range Rover after exchanging messages with her on social media.
But he denies two further charges of sexual activity with a child relating to the same incident.","The ex-girlfriend of former England footballer Adam Johnson has told a jury they split up after he admitted cheating on her with ""quite a few"" women.",35659406,"summary: The ex-girlfriend of former England footballer Adam Johnson has told a jury they split up after he admitted cheating on her with ""quite a few"" women.","A)

"It comes after a bidder to run University Hospital of Hartlepool's fertility services was rejected, despite already running services there.
Hartlepool Borough's council asked the area's clinical commissioning group (CCG) to explore with the bidder how it could reach the required standard.
But, the CCG said it could not lawfully treat one bidder differently.
Care Fertility, which operates 15 clinics across Britain and supports fertility services in Hartlepool, said in January it was ""disappointed not to be awarded the contract"".
The council's audit and governance committee asked the CCG to discuss with the firm how it could reduce risks highlighted in its rejected tender.
The CCG said this was not ""reasonably practicable"".
""It is simply not the role of the CCG to guide bidders to make successful tenders,"" it said.
It would be an ""unusual and unwelcome"" precedent for the CCG to advise bidders and would lead to accusations of unfairness if it did not do the same for all other bidders in the future, it said.
It also said re-tendering would take too long, could increase clinical risk and prolong the gap in the delivery of the service and there was ""no guarantee that the outcome would be any different"".
Last year, the council was granted a High Court injunction to stop the unit's closure, after which it was announced an alternative provider would be sought to run fertility services, including IVF.
The CCG had said it could not recruit enough staff to keep the unit going.",Health managers planning to close a hospital fertility unit have refused to put the service back out to tender.,39378077,summary: Health managers planning to close a hospital fertility unit have refused to put the service back out to tender.,"A)

"Three Victorian hotels will go to make way for a six-storey, four star hotel and two assisted-living apartment blocks, at East Cliff in Bournemouth.
English Heritage strongly objected to the scale of the development in what is a designated conservation area.
But, councillors voted seven to three in favour saying it would help tourism.
Chair of the planning board and Conservative ward councillor David Kelsey, said the buildings earmarked for demolition were nice but no longer ""necessarily functional"".
""They've come to the end of their working lives, we need to preserve the tourism aspect while improving living for older people in the town,"" he said.
""The loss of buildings and trees are always regrettable but we can't stand still, we need to move forward.""
The site on Grove Road and East Overcliff Drive will get a 90-room hotel along with a nine-storey and seven-storey building, comprising 122 assisted-living apartments.
Applicants The East Cliff Project LLP will demolish Bay View Court, The Cottonwood and the Ocean View hotels.
The council received 246 letters supporting the plans.
Forty-nine residents and the Ancient Monuments Society wrote to object to the demolition, stating that despite being altered, they still ""give a sense of the historic character of the area"".

"The city centre road was made pedestrians only from June to November during the redevelopment of the Westgate Shopping Centre.
Now Oxfordshire County Council has agreed to continue the policy when the centre reopens because of the predicted increase in pedestrians.
The ""experimental traffic order"" still has to be signed off by the government.
The closure has also been blamed for increasing pressure on other city centre roads.
When the shopping centre is finished next year there are expected to be 11 million more people using it.
Council officers have estimated the number of pedestrians using the road will increase by 145% from 4,000 per hour up to 9,800 per hour.
They have also calculated that at present, 48 buses per hour use the road.
Officers said in their report that assurances from the bus companies ""do not remove our concern over pedestrian safety"".
But transport boss David Nimmo Smith said he was worried it would cause increased bus traffic in other roads such as St Aldates, which he described as an ""architectural gem"".

"The 24-year-old has agreed a two-year-deal and will arrive following his commitments with the Stormers and Western Province in South Africa.
He is the son of former Springbok Guy Kebble and won the 2012 Under-20s World Championship with South Africa.
""I try and bring an edge to the game and make an impact,"" Kebble told the Pro12 club's website.
""I've watched all of the Glasgow matches in the Champions Cup this season and northern hemisphere rugby is getting very exciting. I'm looking forward to playing in a competitive European league.
""I know Dave Rennie is one of the best coaches in the world, so it's an exciting prospect to work under him next season.""
Kebble will join current team-mate Huw Jones in Glasgow, with the Scotland centre signing a two-year contract with the Warriors earlier this month.
""Huw and I live together in Cape Town,"" he explained. ""We didn't really talk about it too much before it happened, but now it's nice to know there will be a familiar face in Glasgow.""

"Adam Ashe, Stuart Hogg and Henry Pyrgos have all committed to Warriors until 2019.
However, fellow Scotland internationals Mark Bennett, Alex Dunbar, Tommy Seymour and Josh Strauss are out of contract this summer.
""It's really important,"" said Blair of the need to arrange new deals.
""It's difficult with the rugby contracts, you don't often get contracts longer than two years so it seems that every year there's half the squad who are pretty much out of contract. We'll be working hard to keep the guys here.
""There's a lot of money being thrown around in England and France but the product that Glasgow can give - the coaching team, the crowd that we've got, the fact that we beat Racing home and away, we're playing against the best teams in Europe and doing well - hopefully that's a big pull for the guys as well.""
Dave Rennie will replace Gregor Townsend as Glasgow head coach this summer when the latter becomes Scotland head coach.
""Dave Rennie's going to have a say in what's happening here,"" said former Scotland and Edinburgh scrum-half Blair.
""He's watched a lot of the games from the last two or three seasons to get a handle on what players we've got here and what he likes and what he could potentially bring in.""
American lock Greg Peterson, like Ashe, Hogg and Pyrgos, has signed a new deal at Scotstoun and is nearing a return to the first team following long-term injury, along with Tjiuee Uanivi, Scott Cummings and Richie Vernon.
""We're expecting to see them back in the next two or three weeks,"" explained Blair.
""They're taking part in all the non-contact stuff so they're progressing well.
""Pete Horne's showing good progress. He's another couple of weeks before he can step up and we'll see how he reacts to that.
""It's good timing for us. We've got some good quality players coming back. They'll be in a good place when they come back in.
""We've got some big games coming up and some big games during the Six Nations as well once the guys are away on [Scotland duty].""
Glasgow host Cardiff Blues in the Pro12 on Saturday with the Warriors, who are fifth, nine points ahead of the Welsh province.
European Champions Cup encounters with Munster and Leicester Tigers follow, with Townsend's men currently top of Pool 1.
""We're really pleased with how things have gone recently,"" said Blair. ""We've done well to be where we are, despite having the home losses [earlier this season].
""We're in a reasonable position. We're in a better position than we were this time last year.""

"There have been ongoing industrial problems in the school for months.
The panel consists of leading educationalist Prof Sir Robert Salisbury, trade unionist John Corey and Belfast Metropolitan College's principal Marie-ThÃ©rÃ¨se McGivern.
Education Minister John O'Dowd has said he wants them to complete the investigation by early summer.
The secondary school, in the Andersonstown area of west Belfast, has 1,100 pupils.
About a third of its 70-strong teaching staff were absent for a period prior to Easter, and, in an unusual move last month, an associate principal was appointed to the school.
A group representing some parents also held a number of protests to express their concern about how the disputes were affecting their children.
Mr O'Dowd said that he wanted the panel to investigate events in the school, and make recommendations ""to ensure the school's future"".
""I consider the panel members to be eminently well qualified and experienced,"" he said.
""My priority continues to be to the pupils at the school and this investigation will give pupils, parents, staff and their representatives, and all those involved with the governance of the school, the opportunity to express their view.""
The investigation will look at staff relationships, the role of senior leadership, governance of the school and the impact of the ongoing disputes on pupils.
Mr Corey was general secretary of Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (NIPSA) union from 2003-10 and is currently a member of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.
Prior to her role at Belfast Metropolitan College, Ms McGivern was director of development at Belfast City Council.
Sir Robert, meanwhile, recently chaired the literacy and numeracy task force in Northern Ireland and is a former professor of education at the University of Nottingham.
The National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT), which represents almost half the teachers at De La Salle College, welcomed the appointments.
It said the move ""should reassure all partners in the De La Salle community that Minister O'Dowd is committed to finding a robust resolution to the recent period of challenge"".
However, it said the terms of reference would be ""critical to the success or otherwise of the investigation"".
The NASUWT also said it will ""seek assurances from the panel that their work will not cause any further disruption"".
Jim Clarke, chief executive of the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS), also welcomed the appointment of the panel.
""The background and experience of those who will be carrying out the investigation gives confidence to the process,"" he said.
""CCMS will continue with its ongoing work with the other interests through the agreed strategy. It remains focused on the needs and interests of the pupils at the school.""",A three-person panel has been appointed to carry out an investigation into De La Salle College in west Belfast.,36163760,summary: A three-person panel has been appointed to carry out an investigation into De La Salle College in west Belfast.,"A)

"The Bulls' fate has been in the balance since the full extent of their financial worries emerged in the weeks since their dramatic final-day escape sent Chester down instead.
Chester have been reinstated as a Conference Premier club and Hayes & Yeading will stay in Conference South.
""Hereford United can have no complaints. The Conference bent over backwards to help them.
""I described the news of the board's offer of an extension on Friday evening as not so much 'last chance saloon', but rather 'last orders in last chance saloon' and United have seemingly chosen not to offer the league the assurances they were seeking.
""It is a desperately sad day for all Hereford supporters, but the Bulls have nobody to blame but themselves.
""You have to feel very sorry for those players who gave their all at Aldershot on the last day of the season to keep Hereford in the Conference Premier. Sadly, those efforts now count for nothing.""
The Conference had originally offered a payment deadline of Thursday, 5 June.
The club's debt to their football creditors, including former boss Martin Foyle, members of the current squad, other club staff and clubs from whom the Bulls loaned players during the 2013-14 season, added up to £148,000.
That deadline was extended three times, to Friday, 6 June, then again to Saturday, 7 June and for a third time until Thursday, 12 June.
But it became clear on Tuesday that the Bulls, taken over last week by London businessman Tommy Agombar, would not make that deadline - and the Conference has now acted.
The last team to be expelled from the Conference was Chester City in February 2010.
They reformed as Chester FC two months later - and it is now they who have taken the Bulls' place, following a dramatic final day of the season when, almost simultaneously, a late Hereford winning goal at Aldershot and a Salisbury equaliser at Chester kept the Bulls up.
By way of an added twist, Chester announced on Tuesday that Kingsley James, who was in Hereford's team that day, has moved to Bumpers Lane.
26 April - Hereford stay up on final day of Conference Premier season
29 April - Hereford United Supporters' Trust make offer to buy the club for £1 and clear their £220,000 debts
22 May -  Former Bulls boss Martin Foyle serves winding-up petition over unpaid wages, after players reveal they have not been fully paid too
2 June - Case adjourned for 28 days at Royal Court of Justice
3 June - Tommy Agombar takes over as new Hereford owner
5 June - Hereford fail to meet 17:00 BST deadline to pay football creditors, and are threatened with expulsion, subject to Conference board vote
6 June - Hereford meet with Conference board and are given new deadline of 7 June. The deadline is moved to 9 June, then 12 June
10 June - Hereford expelled from Football Conference
And former Hereford boss Foyle, now manager at Southport, chose the same day to sign another player from that same Bulls team, keeper Dan Lloyd-Weston, who opted to leave as he was still owed part of his salary.
When last season ended, despite months of fundraising efforts by fans, as well as generous donations from fans of other clubs, the Bulls faced debts of approximately £225,000.
They still owe over £70,000 to clear the latest PAYE tax demand from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
An offer was made by one of the club's main fan bodies, the Hereford United Supporters' Trust (HUST), on the back of pledges made by their backers, to buy the club for £1 and take over the running at Edgar Street.
But, although chairman David Keyte held talks with them, they were not the preferred option.
Keyte was reported to have been in talks with three different rival bidders before Agombar's takeover.
The downward spiral of Hereford's financial situation since being relegated from the Football League in May 2012 has been exacerbated by falling gates.
The average attendance for the 2013-14 season at Edgar Street was 1,758, little over half the average gate they attracted of 3,270 in League Two just five years ago.",Hereford United have been expelled from the Football Conference following the club's failure to pay their bills.,27786442,summary: Hereford United have been expelled from the Football Conference following the club's failure to pay their bills.,"A)

"His grandmother offered him a plate of grapes, but she doesn't remember whether Faizan had it. The son of a farmer then put on his pheran, the woollen cape-like garment Kashmiris wear, and quietly left for his Sunday lessons.
A few hours later, Faizan lay dead near a sun-baked school playground, ringed by bare walnut and willow trees. Paramilitary soldiers, eyewitnesses alleged, had shot him in the back of his head.
Carrying a packet of biscuits, he was returning home on a bright, nippy morning when he encountered a throng of local people protesting against Indian rule near the school, where polling was taking place for a parliamentary by-election.
Eyewitnesses say four shots rang out of the single-storey, squat school building which, according to some reports, was being pelted with stones thrown by protesters from a hill above and from the road in front.
Faizan possibly halted to find out what the commotion was all about, and was hit by a bullet. Two neighbours ran up to his home to deliver the news. His mother had sprinted down to the playground, hugged her bleeding son and let others take him to hospital.
""I knew he was gone,"" Zarifa told me.
A heart-wrenching video recorded by a villager on his mobile phone minutes after the killing shows a wailing man cradling the dead boy, blood streaming down his broken face, in a packed vehicle taking him to the nearest hospital. There, the doctors declared him dead.
Faizan's final journey is recorded on another mobile phone video: his slight frame, draped in white, bobbing slightly on a hospital cot, carried through a sea of weeping, agitated mourners extolling their latest ""martyr"". By late afternoon, his body was lowered into the grave near his village, Dalwan.
Faizan was among the eight people killed on Sunday when paramilitary soldiers fired bullets and shotgun pellets at those protesting against Indian rule at polling centres near Srinagar, the summer capital. Election authorities say some 170 people, including 100 security personnel, were injured in about 200 incidents of stone pelting and violent protests on the day.
The voter turnout in Sunday's election was an abysmal 7.1% - the lowest in decades - and came as a huge setback for the region's mainstream parties.
The soldiers had been brought in from other states to secure polling stations and may have been unprepared to deal with ""protests and provocation"" in a complex conflict zone like Kashmir, a senior official told me.
One report said the police had registered complaints against the paramilitary forces for firing into the crowds.
Separatist groups had rejected the elections and urged voters to boycott Sunday's poll, which took place after a politician resigned over what he described as the ""anti-people"" agenda of the Indian government.
Disillusioned voters - even in relatively peaceful places like Dalwan where people turned out to cast their votes enthusiastically in previous elections - generally stayed away.
Why Faizan was killed on a day when local voters rejected the ballot is not clear.
By all accounts, he was not pelting stones or hurling abuse at the soldiers. One report said police fired tear gas shells to keep the protesters away from the empty polling station, but the soldiers opened fire.
Whatever it is, Faizan became another grisly statistic in Kashmir's unending tragedy.
A picture taken by his friend on his mobile phone during their winter break shows the shy-looking boy - ""he would often top his class, and he was very knowledgeable about the world,"" the friend said - clad in a woollen cap and collared jacket, peering uneasily into the camera.
""He was quiet and studious, he was doing well in school. He played cricket, and counted [former Indian captain] MS Dhoni as his favourite cricketer. He wanted to become a doctor,"" a cousin told me, when I visited the family.
Grief is the price one pays for love. Zarifa's lament for her dead son filled the still air inside a tent outside their home where local women had gathered to mourn.
""My son, my son, where will I find you now?"" she cried, again and again.
Then she stepped out of the tent, entered her home and joined her husband in a dank, cold room. He sat there, stoic and numb, surrounded by mourners, and gazed vacantly at the pastel pink walls. The room had a red carpet and red window curtains.
""The blood of a martyr never goes waste,"" said Fayaz Ahmad Dar. ""One day, the blood of innocents will help us gain our freedom [from Indian rule].""
A brief silence followed. Zarifa broke it, bemoaning the loss of her boy.
""I am looking at your books, I am looking at your school bags. How will I touch your books again, my son? Everybody would talk about your intelligence, how you would answer every question with so much wit.""
Outside the secondary school - Enter to learn, Leave to serve, its motto, is engraved on the walls - a group of young men gathered later in the day. Their eyes seethed in anger. They spoke about frustration, alienation, desperation, humiliation and hopelessness.
They said they had lost their fear of life. They insisted that they helped rebels because ""they are our brothers and don't kill civilians"" and are ""fighting for freedom"".
More than half of them raised their hands when asked whether they had pelted stones at Indian forces.
""We are not safe in our own homes, we are not safe on streets. They are killing little boys now. Life is uncertain,"" said Feroze Ali, a school clerk.
Since February alone, some two dozen civilians have been killed during gunfights between armed rebels and security forces. The security forces have accused civilians of helping rebels escape.
The army says it has tried to reach out and engage with civilians through its 29 schools, youth clubs and cricket tournaments.
Recently some 19,000 Kashmiri young men applied for a few hundred vacancies in the army.
""Provocation and panic can lead to accidents. Security forces often fire when they face life threatening situations. But protecting civilians remains our first priority in this situation. When a civilian dies, it hurts us,"" an army officer told me.
The region has seen heightened tension and increased unrest since July when influential militant Burhan Wani was killed by Indian forces. More than 100 civilians lost their lives in clashes with protesters during a four-month-long lockdown, including a 55-day-curfew, in the restive Muslim-majority valley.
Kashmir, clearly, appears to be teetering on the brink of an open public revolt against Indian rule.
Many say the federal government's near-complete lack of engagement and dialogue with local stakeholders and Pakistan, a complete mistrust of the local government and a lack of development and jobs have left most people jittery and alienated.
Militancy continues to be at low ebb - there are an estimated 250 militants in the state now of which 150 are local - compared to several thousand during the peak of insurgency in the 1990s.
But young Kashmiris - more than 60% of the men in the valley are under 30, and more than 40% of men in Kashmir are jobless - are restless and angry. The local political parties are in danger of ""becoming irrelevant"", as a leader of an opposition party told me.
""This is the worst situation that I have seen. Earlier, it was a movement led by the militants. Now it is being led by the people,"" says Feroze Ali, 35, a schoolteacher.

"Neil Trotter admitted taking pictures of women at Edinburgh's Waverley Station and Glasgow's Buchanan Galleries between June and September 2014.
A sheriff told the 54-year-old, from Falkirk, that ""women should be able to walk without fear"" in public places.
He was also placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years.
A previous hearing at Edinburgh Sheriff Court was told that Trotter travelled into Edinburgh daily by train to go to work.
On Monday 29 September, a fellow passenger noted him walking in ""a curious, a sinister manner"" at Waverley Station, ""clearly making an effort to get very close to a female ahead of him"" on the escalator.
Fiscal depute Aidan Higgins, prosecuting, told the court that ""it was clear he was using his phone to get under the lady's skirt, taking photographs"".
The commuter reported his concerns to British Transport Police and Trotter was identified from CCTV footage. He was detained as he left the station the following day.
Examination of Trotter's phone and his home computer established that he had been using his mobile on various days between 11 June and 29 September, with 22 videos showing the camera had been directed under women's skirts.
Defence solicitor Neil Hay told the court Trotter was ""most ashamed of his actions"", and ""well aware his behaviour is unacceptable"".
He said his client had ""lost his career, brought his family to the brink of financial ruin and brought shame and humiliation to himself and those very close to him"".
Sentencing him to 18 months in prison, Sheriff Peter Braid told Trotter: ""You have pled guilty to taking images of women in a clandestine manner, prompted by voyeuristic impulses for your own sexual gratification.
""This involved significant planning committed over a period of more than three months in public places where women should be able to walk without fear.
""The repugnance society must feel towards these offences is such that, in my view, there is no alternative to a custodial sentence, in retribution and to deter others.""",A former senior information officer for the Scottish government has been jailed for 18 months for using his mobile phone to take photos up women's skirts.,33551522,summary: A former senior information officer for the Scottish government has been jailed for 18 months for using his mobile phone to take photos up women's skirts.,"A)

"Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson endorsed her party's UK manifesto.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the Conservatives were ""talking up"" the SNP's prospects.
SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was in New Lanark, while Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy was on the campaign trail in Cumbernauld.
Speaking at the Dawnfresh fish factory in Uddingston, Ms Davdison believed that a Labour government propped up by the SNP would be damaging for the UK's finances.
She said that under a Conservative government minimum wage earners would pay no income tax.
Ms Davidson added: ""We're the party which will sort out the economy so that we can afford a great NHS and give you and your family the chance to make the most of your lives.
""The SNP and Labour have the brass neck to pretend that they have a plan for the economy but any plan based on more taxes, more borrowing and more debt would wreck all the hard work of the last five years.""
However, Mr Rennie, who was campaigning in Pittenweem, said the Conservatives, were ""putting their party before their country by seeking to increase their vote share at any price"".
He added: ""The Conservative election campaign has repeatedly talked up the SNP. Immediately after the UK leaders debates, George Osborne was talking up the performance of Nicola Sturgeon.
""I am not sure what kind of bizarre tactical game he was playing but it can only have helped the SNP increase their support further.
""And now the Conservatives in Scotland are getting in the way of our battles to stop the SNP in the 11 Westminster seats we hold in Scotland.""
What are the top issues for each political party at the 2015 general election?
Policy guide: Where the parties stand
Ms Sturgeon attacked both the Tories and Labour as she continued election campaigning.
She said: ""People in Scotland have always known to expect harsh, ideological cuts from the Tories - and today's cuts manifesto is likely to be more of the same. But that Labour have been so quick to meekly fall into line with George Osborne's plans just goes to show how far they have moved away from their roots.
""And with Ed Balls lifting the lid on Labour's cuts plans yesterday and finally putting an end to Jim Murphy's anti-cuts pretence, Labour's commitment to austerity is clear for all to see.""
The SNP leader and first minister of Scotland had earlier taken questions from listeners on BBC Radio's Five Live morning phone in.
In response to a question from presenter Nicky Campbell, Ms Sturgeon reiterated that she was not planning another independence referendum. She said that if you voted SNP on 7 May, you were not voting for another referendum.
In Cumbernauld, Mr Murphy said SNP plans for Scottish taxes supporting Scotland's finances would mean millions lost for working families in tax credits.
Mr Murphy said: ""The SNP's reckless plans will cost working families the most, with a £7.6bn black hole in Scotland's finances and the end of the UK welfare state as we know it.
""Scotland doesn't have to choose between Tory austerity or SNP austerity max. Scottish Labour is the only party on the ballot paper offering a real alternative to austerity.
""Only Labour is big enough and strong enough to kick the Tories out and give working families the support they need.""
Meanwhile, the Scottish Greens backed the manifesto commitments of the Green Party of England and Wales which they believe would make a positive difference to people's lives.
Alison Johnstone, from the Scottish Greens said: ""Greens across these islands are clear: we must end Westminster's failed austerity experiment.""
Voters throughout the UK go to the polls on 7 May to choose their next MP.

"Perry Beeches III is one of a chain of six free schools. Mr Cameron described the schools as ""a real success story"".
But the Ofsted report said too many students were underachieving and described teaching as ""inadequate"".
Perry Beeches chief executive Liam Nolan said he ""fundamentally disagreed"" with the inspectors.
The school's headteacher, Darren Foreman, its senior leadership team and chair of governors have resigned, Mr Nolan said.
Mr Nolan has taken on the role of interim head teacher, together with Jackie Powell.
The report said: ""Teaching is inadequate. Too much is dull and fails to engage students who became bored and start to fidget.""
It also accused the school's leadership of having an, ""unrealistic and inaccurate"" view of the school and added students' behaviour required improvement.
Mr Nolan said: ""This judgement makes me question Ofsted's credibility.""
However he said he intended to work with Ofsted to make the school outstanding.
He described the report as an, ""unfortunate blip"".
He said: ""Within six months you will see us back on the top.""
The Perry Beeches schools are funded by central government but not run by local authorities.
Two of the other schools in the chain have been rated ""outstanding"" by Ofsted.
Perry Beeches III was opened by the Prime Minister in September 2013.
At the time, he said the majority of free schools were, ""a real success story we should build on as a country"".
A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Liam Nolan and the Perry Beeches free schools are transforming the life chances of children in Birmingham, in some of the most deprived communities of the country.
""The performance of Perry Beeches I and II has set the bar for schools across the rest of the country.

"Oxfordshire County Council said two independent studies found having one organisation to run all services could save £100m over five years.
But the plan is opposed by the county's five district councils, who have argued in favour of three councils instead.
All the authorities have been criticised for engaging in a ""turf war"" over their rival devolution plans.
County council leader Ian Hudspeth said public money should be spent on providing services, rather than running ""six separate organisations"".
The district councils have argued the county needs an elected mayor, rather than fewer councillors, to get more money from Whitehall.
Oxford City Council leader Bob Price said the county's plan was ""the wrong proposal at the wrong time"".
He added: ""For the people of Oxford, a unitary council would be a disaster.
""The needs of a multi-ethnic and socially mixed urban community are very different to the more rural parts of the county.""
Leader of West Oxfordshire District Council James Mills said the aim of the district councils' devolution bid was to get more money from central government.
He said: ""A mayor gives a strong voice to Oxford, single point of contact to government and is accountable to the people of Oxfordshire.""
But Mr Hudspeth said the proposal was needed because the county council ""cannot continue to make savings without further cuts to local services"".
He said: ""One council for Oxfordshire would be more efficient and simpler for residents, with one phone number, one website and one point of contact.""

"It allows users to control games on the touchscreen devices and can show extra information about progress.
It also lets the handhelds act as controllers for the firm's Internet Explorer web browser, which will launch on the console later this year.
The move poses a challenge to Nintendo's Wii U Game Pad.
While the Japanese company's product is specifically designed to enhance the experience of using its next-generation console, Microsoft is offering users a way to extend the functionality of its existing games machines via third-party devices they may already have.
""Xbox SmartGlass works with all the devices that you already own: the TV you already own, the phone you already own and the tablet you already own,"" said Marc Whitten, head of Microsoft's Xbox Live division.
""Xbox SmartGlass turns any TV into a smart TV.""
A demo showed the highly anticipated first-person shooter Halo 4 using the facility to trigger maps and other data about its in-game environment.
The announcement
 was made in Microsoft's keynote presentation at the E3 video games trade show in Los Angeles.
Mr Whitten added that SmartGlass would also enhance television programmes and films streamed through the Xbox.
He gave the example of a viewer watching Game of Thrones on their television and being able to look down at their tablets to see where on-screen characters were located on a map of the show's fantasy world.
The demonstration also showed how the linked device could bring up details about the cast and characters while the user was watching a film.
""It lets Microsoft say that you don't need to buy new hardware to have a two-screen experience,"" Stephen Totilo, editor of gaming website Kotaku, told the BBC.
""Nintendo looked to be ahead of everyone else on this, but now Microsoft is breathing down its neck. But there may be a little bit of smoke and mirrors here as I'm not convinced SmartGlass will have as much functionality as the Wii U offers.""
The app was also mocked by South Park's creator Trey Parker who was at the event to promote a new video game featuring his characters.
""How many times have you been watching an episode of South Park and thought I'd like to be able to watch this on my television while hooked into my mobile device which is being controlled by my tablet device which is hooked into my oven all while sitting in the refrigerator,"" he joked.
New uses for Microsoft's Kinect motion and voice sensor also featured heavily in the E3 presentation.
A tie-up with Nike
 will deliver a title towards the end of the year in which a digital personal trainer offers feedback on owners' workout techniques based on information gathered by the Kinect.
Voice commands were shown being used to change team formations in the next edition of the American Football simulation John Madden NFL, and to call in air strikes in the action game Splinter Cell Blacklist.
A new game called Wrecketer also allows players to use gestures to launch and guide missiles to destroy castles in a title based around a similar concept to Angry Birds.
Microsoft also promoted its device as an entertainment hub.
A new service called Xbox Music will offer ""over 30 million music tracks"" to the Xbox as well as Windows 8 and Windows Phone devices.
A video suggested the service would rival similar offerings from Spotify, Rdio and others. However, details were scant with no launch date or countries mentioned, and no comment about how it would affect the firm's existing Zune product.
US users were promised new content including NBA basketball games, Paramount Pictures movies and Nickelodeon children's programmes.
Much of the rest of the presentation was dedicated to trailers showcasing new titles in existing video game franchises such as Tomb Raider, Fable, Call of Duty and Resident Evil.
""We're probably getting a new Xbox console in 2013 so that will be what the next E3 is about, so they had to spend this year talking about the stuff that precedes it,"" said Mr Totilo.
""But people who get upset about sequels forget they tend to be some of the best games ever made as developers don't have to worry about working with new hardware, and can instead hone their craft and be creative.""",Microsoft has unveiled Xbox SmartGlass: a service to allow tablet computers and smartphones to communicate with its video games consoles.,18325815,summary: Microsoft has unveiled Xbox SmartGlass: a service to allow tablet computers and smartphones to communicate with its video games consoles.,"A)

"The FA says the club, one of a few from outside the English mainland to enter, must play any replays in England - even if they are the home side.
The club would also have to pay the travel expenses of visiting sides.
Those expenses, which come after the club has shared any gate receipts, mean Guernsey are considering whether they can afford to enter the competition.
The club, founded in 2011, also want to play in the FA Trophy, and director Nigel Braybrook told BBC South West Sport: ""They're very prestigious competitions and the players have earned the right to take part.
""We feel they deserve the chance to show themselves on the national stage, but that could be taken away from us for non-football reasons.""
Guernsey are used to paying for clubs to come over to the island to play them, having spent the past two seasons in the Combined Counties League,
They also made the semi-finals of the FA Vase,
As well as any home replays being played at a venue in England at Guernsey's expense, the club would also have to play any postponed home ties in England as well.
A Channel Island team has competed in an FA Cup before. Jersey's St Peter's ladies side played in the 2004 FA Women's Cup, losing 3-1 to Aldershot Town in the first qualifying round.
The FA has given Guernsey until Monday, 24 June to decide if they want to enter on those terms, and told BBC South West Sport that they would not comment until that time.
""They haven't given a reason, they've just set out these conditions,"" Braybrook said.
""I can only imagine their concern is that opposing clubs would have to travel over midweek, and at a lower level some of the players will have to work and they may have concerns about that.
""We would love to be in the competition but it's purely finance.
""Playing in the Ryman League this year will increase our costs considerably, with more matches, more overnight stays and longer journeys.
""If we play a game on the mainland, drew and then pay for the replay, it could potentially cost us £10,000 to play one round.""

"Hawick Knitwear, which employs more than 230 staff, has also increased its production of sweaters to meet demand.
Production has been boosted by better than expected sales of the Hawick Knitwear-branded range which launched in January.
The company, which dates back to 1874, was bought by managing director Benny Hartop in November last year.
As well as the new range, the firm has seen growth of its longer-established business of supplying customers who sell the garments under their private labels.
In Europe, Hawick Knitwear sells into Sweden, Finland, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Italy and Spain.
Markets outside Europe include the USA, Canada, Mexico, and Japan.
The knitwear firm has increased its production to 9,500 sweaters each week, from about 7,500 last year, to keep up with demand.
Mr Hartop said: ""The increase in production is in direct response to a surge in orders from both home and abroad for our private label clients and now for our own brand too.
""There will always be challenges but thankfully our future is looking very good and this is a testament to the dedicated staff working at all levels of the business.

He said: ""I don't think I'm any further forward. The AAIB - they think it was switches that were left on - or weren't left on.
""My main question to them was flight recorders -  if they had flight recorders, it would have taken us a fraction of the time it has taken us.
""Personally I feel calmer than I did before I went in. I can't keep shouting at the moon for the rest of my life although I feel I want to.""
Investigators are due to hold another closed meeting with bereaved relatives on Thursday and have asked families not to discuss the detailed findings until the report's official publication on Friday.
John McGarrigle, whose father John died, said he felt ""let down"" despite optimism ahead of AAIB meeting.
Mr McGarrigle said: ""All tonight has done for me is raise loads more questions. My head is scrambled, I'm that angry.
""Flight data recorders should be installed in every passenger-carrying aircraft - simple as. If we had that, we would know a lot more.
""We wouldn't know the full cause, but we would know half of the reasons at least and we would have learned from it.""
Jim Morris, an aviation law expert with Irwin Mitchell Solicitors, also said the lack of a ""black box"" had hampered the investigation.
He said: ""Unfortunately, in my view, due to a lack of a requirement to fit a black box flight data recorder, we have almost more unanswered questions.""
Mr Morris added: ""We still do not know why fuel did not reach the engines.
""The report goes into significant detail in its analysis but it is clear from what is said in the report that they can't answer all the questions.""
Anne-Marie Kennedy, who was working behind the bar and was trapped in the wreckage, said she was ""satisfied"" with how the briefing went.
She said: ""It's shown me that they should have black boxes for defo, it's shown me the need for other regulation, but other than that nothing.
""Until I speak to my legal team I can only speculate.
""I'm satisfied with the way the night went. I believe that the AAIB has done everything in their power.
""The guy explained the investigation, the complexity and the length of time. They did all they could.""

The Police Scotland Eurocopter EC 135, operated by Bond Air Services, came down on to the roof of the Clutha Bar at about 22:25 on a busy Friday night.
The helicopter crew who were killed were pilot David Traill, PC Tony Collins and PC Kirsty Nelis.
The seven customers in the Clutha who died were John McGarrigle, Mark O'Prey, Gary Arthur, Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins, Samuel McGhee and Joe Cusker.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) issued an interim report last year which said that both engines on the helicopter ""flamed out"" due to a fuel supply problem.

"An ultra low emission zone in London for the most polluting cars will come into force in April 2019 and reports say other cities will follow suit.
The government will also produce a new air quality plan by the end of April.
But Theresa May has said she will ""take into account"" drivers encouraged to buy diesel cars by previous governments.
Former Labour Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced a lower vehicle tax in 2001 to encourage people to buy diesel cars, as they were more economical and thought to be less harmful in terms of carbon dioxide emissions.
But there has been increasing concern from experts that the vehicles emit dangerous levels of nitrogen dioxide, which is thought to have caused thousands of premature deaths in the UK.
The government has to produce a new air quality plan after receiving a ""final warning"" from the European Commission about breaches of legal air quality levels in the UK.
It also lost two court cases in 2015 and 2016 over pollution levels brought by environmental lawyers ClientEarth.
To tackle the issue, a so-called ""toxin tax"" is expected to be rolled out across several cities, charging drivers of diesel cars up to Â£20 per day to come into urban areas.
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan announced on Tuesday that such a scheme - creating an the ultra low emission zone in the capital - would come into force in two years' time, with a charge of Â£12.50 for petrol cars that do not meet Euro 4 standards and diesel vehicles that do not meet Euro 6 standards.
But motoring organisations have said diesel car drivers are being ""punished"" for following a previous government's policy.
Mrs May has now hinted there will be schemes to help drivers who were told that diesel vehicles were the right purchase.
Speaking on her trip to Jordan and Saudi Arabia, she said: ""Decisions will be taken when we produce that [air quality] plan.
""But I'm very conscious of the fact that past governments have encouraged people to buy diesel cars and we need to take that into account when we look at what we do in the future. ""
She did not set out any specific plans, but there have been reports of a scrappage scheme that could pay people to get rid of their diesel vehicles.","Diesel car owners could get some help from the government if cities adopt new charges to tackle pollution, the prime minister has suggested.",39499331,"summary: Diesel car owners could get some help from the government if cities adopt new charges to tackle pollution, the prime minister has suggested.","A)

"Ian Toothill said he believes he is the first cancer patient to scale the world's highest mountain.
The Sheffield Wednesday fan planted a flag of rivals Sheffield United at the summit for charity.
The 47-year-old personal trainer, who reached the summit on Monday, has raised almost £31,500 ($40,600) for Macmillan.
He tweeted: ""Nothing to see here, just some cancer dude [Sheffield Wednesday] fan on the summit of Everest with a @SUFC_tweets flag.""
Live updates and this and other stories from Yorkshire
Mr Toothill, originally from Sheffield, lives in Willesden Green in London and has climbed in the Himalayas.
He was diagnosed with bowel cancer in June 2015 and told in early 2016 that he had beaten the disease, but later found out it had returned.
He said he has been told he has ""just several months left to live"".
Speaking to BBC Radio Sheffield in February, he said: ""I'm determined to prove anything is possible.""
He reached the top of the North Col route on 16 May and the summit of Everest on 5 June.
Miss NJP tweeted: ""What an amazing achievement and a wonderful moment for @IanToothill. Feeling emotional. So glad you made it to the top #climbingforcancer"".
The Sheffield Wednesday fan planted the rival Sheffield United flag at the summit after a friend donated £1,000.
Mr Toothill was accompanied part-way of the climb by Leslie Binns, from Rotherham, who abandoned his climb to the summit after saving the life of a fellow climber last June.

"Many lizards can detach their tails when attacked, but fish-scale geckos have large scales that tear away with ease.
The new species is a master of this art, say scientists, having the largest scales of any known gecko.
The reptile, named Geckolepis megalepis, is described in PeerJ.
The skin of fish-scale geckos is specially adapted to tearing. The large scales are attached only by a relatively narrow region that tears with ease.
In addition, beneath the scales there is a pre-formed splitting zone within the skin itself.
Although several other geckos are able to lose their skin like this if they are grasped firmly, fish-scale geckos are able to do so actively - and at the slightest touch.
They can also grow them back scar-free in a matter of weeks, while other geckos might take a long time to regenerate their scales.
But Geckolepis megalepis is remarkable for the huge size of its scales. The researchers hypothesise that larger scales tear more easily than smaller ones, because of their greater surface area relative to the attachment area, and larger friction surface.
""What's really remarkable though is that these scales - which are really dense and may even be bony, and must be quite energetically costly to produce - and the skin beneath them tear away with such ease, and can be regenerated quickly and without a scar,"" said lead author Mark Scherz, from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.
The new species was discovered in the Tsingy cave formations of northern Madagascar.",A newly discovered species of gecko has tearaway skin that leaves predators with nothing but a mouthful of scales when attacked.,38897327,summary: A newly discovered species of gecko has tearaway skin that leaves predators with nothing but a mouthful of scales when attacked.,"A)

"When Google paid $3.2bn (Â£2.1bn) to buy Tony Fadell's start-up Nest in 2014, it got much more than just an internet-connected thermostat and smoke detector.
It got the man dubbed the ""the iPod's father"" - the engineer/designer who sold Steve Jobs on his vision of a portable music player, and then worked alongside Jony Ive to build it, update it and then repeat the process with the iPhone.
Now, the two men are set to go head-to-head. First with wearable tech, and then later, perhaps, with competing car designs - more of which later.
Tellingly, Mr Fadell reveals he recently started testing Sir Jonathan's latest product, the Apple Watch, although he was not wearing it at the time of interview.
""I've had mine for about two weeks now,"" he says.
""I think they did a tremendous job on the hardware components of it.
""They are trying many different things with that platform - some are going to be great, and some are not.""
When Mr Fadell agreed to sell Nest to Google, the reason he gave was that joining forces would accelerate his ""thoughtful home"" master plan - he hates the term ""internet of things"", which he says does a ""disservice"" to his products.
But in January, it became clear that Google's chief executive, Larry Page, had wider uses for his hardware expertise, and the troubled Glass computer was added to his duties.
""It wasn't handed to me and said, 'Tony clean it up,'"" Mr Fadell clarifies, ""I offered.""
""I remember what it was like when we did the iPod and the iPhone. I think this can be that important, but it's going to take time to get it right.""
The $1,500 (Â£965) ""explorer edition"" of Glass was soon pulled from sale, and Mr Fadell made clear that future test versions would be kept in-house.
That was widely seen as a shift in strategy for Google - a company that took five years to take its Gmail service out of ""beta"" status, and that still invites users to ""play"" with preview versions of other products.
Moreover, it caused anger among developers who had sunk time and money into making apps for a product that no longer existed.
But Mr Fadell defends the shift, saying a distinction needed to be drawn between hardware and software.
""If you are only doing services based on electrons, you can iterate quickly, test it, and modify it and get it right,"" he says.
""But when you are dealing with actual atoms - hardware - and you have to get manufacturing lines and it takes a year or more to develop that product, you better understand what it is and what it's trying to do and specifically what it's not going to do.
""Customers have to spend money to buy those atoms.
""They want something that delivers value or you end up with a real disappointment and you can spoil the market.""
For now, that leaves Mr Fadell's reputation dependent on his Nest line-up.
It is limited to three products, including the recently launched Nest Cam.
The motion-detecting camera streams live footage and sound from the owner's home to an app and can save memorable moments in the cloud.
If you get over the creepiness factor of effectively spying on your family, it's fair to say the device shares the crisp, stylish look of the Nest's other products, and reviews have been positive.
But the camera is actually an upgrade to an earlier device made by Dropcam - a company Nest acquired.
That means Mr Fadell's division has not created a new product category of its own since joining Google.
Bearing in mind, Mr Page told him to ""keep doing what you're doing, and do it as fast as you possibly can"", it raises the question: what's taking so long?
""Talk to me about the number of home product companies who have come out with three different product categories in less than five years... are shipping and they are the number ones in their category,"" says Mr Fadell, slightly bristling.
""I would love to have more, faster.
""But it takes time - it really takes time to make these products to the level of design and near-perfection that we achieve.""
He adds that Nest's biggest goal right now is to expand the range of third-party products its devices talk to - for example its Thermostats can switch LG fridges into energy-saving mode when no-one's in, and its Protect sensors can make Philip's Hue lights flash red if they detect smoke or carbon monoxide.
But such advances have less impact than a new product.
""Despite his substantial success to date and involvement in key products such as Apple iPod, Mr Fadell has arguably not yet reached the truly iconic status bestowed upon Jonathan Ive,"" Ben Wood, from the tech consultancy CCS Insight, says.
""Given the huge amount Google invested in the acquisition of Nest to secure his services there must be an expectation that he too can deliver his own portfolio of truly disruptive devices with mass appeal.
""Google still lacks a smash-hit consumer electronics device of its own - it would be sensible to assume it hopes Mr Fadell can deliver that missing element.""
The two men worked together on first iPods and iPhones, but are credited with different achievements.
With the iPod, Mr Fadell first convinced Steve Jobs of the wisdom of developing a portable music player and then worked out how to incorporate a hard drive - a fragile component - into a device that could be thrown about, sat on and generally abused.
Jony Ive's breakthrough was his design of its thumb-wheel, which scrolled through songs more rapidly as it was spun more quickly.
With the iPhone, perhaps Mr Fadell's greatest feat was finding a way to shrink the tech necessary to offer a multi-touch user interface on a handheld device.
Jony Ive's skill was best summed up by one writer as making the final product look almost more like ""a piece of jewellery than a gadget"".
In post-Jobs Apple, Sir Jonathan's influence has grown further - extending to the look of the company's operating system software, the creation of its Watch and even the design of its new headquarters.
By contrast, Mr Fadell has thrived beyond - building and selling a multi-billion dollar company, reinventing mundane household devices as desirable gadgets, and becoming one of Google's key figures.
This leads to thoughts about whether Mr Fadell could become involved in other Google projects.
A question about working on its growing roster of robots is rebuffed on the grounds that they are still a long way from leaving the lab.
But self-driving cars, he adds, are much closer to launch and a ""big curiosity"".
""I don't think you've seen anything of what the design of the car could look like when it first materialises,"" he says.
""How do you make those occupants feel like they are safe and make sure they are safe?
""How does the car exude safety [and be] fashionable as well?
""How does this 'utility' self-driving car also be a reflection of you, right, as well as itself and also be transparent about its safety?
""Those are very interesting questions that still need to be dealt with.""
He adds that he has ""some thoughts"" about the answers and is sharing them with others involved in Google's self-driving car project.
""We are having discussion about them all the time,"" he says.
""I always have ideas - it's whether or not people want to hear them.""
So, nothing official yet.
But it would not be a surprise if Google eventually announces Mr Fadell is adding automobile design to his list of duties.
And if, as rumoured, Sir Jonathan and his team are also working on their own electric car concept, that could set up a fascinating clash between the two former colleagues in the future.",Is Tony Fadell destined to eclipse his former Apple workmate Sir Jonathan Ive?,33551340,summary: Is Tony Fadell destined to eclipse his former Apple workmate Sir Jonathan Ive?,"A)

"Spanish police say he had secretly taken photographs of his students as well as having sent images of other children to people on the internet.
The Manchester-born man reportedly had a ""special obsession"" with a girl he taught.
He was arrested in Valladolid, north-west Spain as part of an Interpol investigation.
Interpol said they discovered illegal files were being sent from an email address in Spain and alerted the authorities.
Police said on Sunday the teacher is suspected of using a cloud storage service to keep and share the pictures between computers and with others.
Officers say they found a large number of sexually explicit files involving minors at the home of the teacher.
He kept photos of one girl in a dedicated folder on his computer but had not shared the images he had secretly taken of his underage students.

"But he did not know the size of block grant coming from the Treasury in London until George Osborne's autumn statement on 25 November.
So with few sleeps and bargain-seeking days to Christmas, the budget process is being delivered this week, and the legislative timetable squeezed.
What can be expected of John Swinney's taxation and spending plans? Let's play budget bingo.
""Osborne's austerity is wrong for Scotland"": There will be a squeeze of more than 5% (the Scottish government prefers a slightly different calculation rounding it up to 6%) in current or revenue (non-capital) spending.
""Difficult decisions have to be made"": If the health service is protected from cuts, and schools too, departments with less than half the budget have to absorb all the cuts.
That is likely to feature local government, which has been told to brace itself for some deep cuts in grant funding over the next five years.
John Swinney could sweeten the pill by allowing them to raise council tax - as George Osborne did south of the border, allowing a 2% council tax rise if it is to pay for social care.
But it will be tempting to stick to a ninth year of freezing council tax, even though that will cost him a cumulated Â£630m out of next year's budget, and even though it is more generous to those with the biggest bills.
""Taxes for a fairer Scotland"": That'll be the reason for not using the new Scottish Rate of Income Tax. Both Mr Swinney and the first minister have said they want to use income tax powers only when they are sufficiently flexible to tilt the burden towards those most able to pay it.
That will probably, eventually, mean a rise in higher rate tax, or changes to thresholds. That flexibility won't be added to this year's new powers until 2017.
""A healthy private rented housing market"": Mr Swinney could choose to follow Mr Osborne's example last month, by raising property transaction tax on buy-to-let homes. It would be a progressive move.
But the Scottish finance secretary doesn't need to burst a house price bubble in and around his capital city. He may also want to give landlords something they like, to make up for the boost to tenants' rights they are soon to face.
""ESA10"": Technical jargon for public finance nerds, but it matters a lot. Mr Swinney has to give more detail than he did last month on the constraints placed on capital projects by a European accounting rule that makes significant capital projects a public liability rather than the private one that had been planned.
""Scottish Fiscal Commission"": This independent, new-ish body will publish its reckoning of Mr Swinney's fiscal projections at the same time his draft budget is delivered. Watch for a shortfall in revenue from Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (the successor to Stamp Duty).
""The A9"": The road is busy, it's being dualled, slowly, and it runs right through Mr Swinney's constituency.
""PFI on steroids"": Labour's Jackie Baillie will complain about the ""debt mountain"" being built up under the SNP. Quoting a report from The Guardian about Â£15bn of council debt and the liabilities resulting from the Public Finance Initiative and its successors, she probably won't explain that a lot of it was built up while she was a minister.
""Capitulation to the powerful roads lobby"": Greens will complain that insufficient money has been directed towards household energy efficiency, and too much is going on building a new Forth crossing and Aberdeen ring road.
""Eye off the ball"": Conservatives will blame any and all shortcomings in public sector performance and economic performance on the SNP government's campaign for independence. It's a way of rallying 'No' voters. Watch Ruth Davidson for pointers towards manifesto tax cut pledges.
""Budget for fairness, for growth and for Scotland"": Whatever is announced, and whatever the reality, Mr Swinney will present his draft budget as all these and more.
""House!"" (Yes, more housing too. It will be a theme of the SNP election campaign.)","John Swinney should have published his draft budget in mid-September, for MSPs to deliberate on it over winter, with a big rubber stamp in plenty time for the start of the financial year.",35110142,"summary: John Swinney should have published his draft budget in mid-September, for MSPs to deliberate on it over winter, with a big rubber stamp in plenty time for the start of the financial year.","A)

"Theme park bosses were informed of the accident on Tuesday at 13:57 BST but ambulance crews said the 999 call was not made until 14:08.
Alton Towers said one of its first responders was soon on the scene and security staff would have called 999 as soon as an assessment had been made.
Sixteen people were hurt, four seriously, when the Smiler crashed.
Crews from the West Midlands Ambulance Service arrived on the scene at 14:35 and they called the fire service at 14:41.
Fire crews were not initially requested by Alton Towers but the park's staff did put their own call in requesting their assistance at 14:45, the fire service said.
In a statement, Alton Towers said: ""Our community first responders, based on site at Alton Towers, are trained by West Midlands Ambulance Service and form part of our security and medical teams.
""Once the incident occurred, a member of the ride staff would have called our first responders who arrived at the scene within minutes.
""After instant assessment they call our security department who then call 999 straight away.""
The crash saw two carriages collide on the Â£18m ride, leaving people trapped 25ft (7.6m up) at an angle of 45 degrees for up to four-and-a-half hours.
Alton Towers said its staff built a platform to reach the injured people, although first responders initially used ladders so they could begin treating patients as soon as possible.
Joe Pugh, 18, and his girlfriend Leah Washington, 17, both from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, suffered ""significant leg injuries"" in the crash.
Daniel Thorpe, 27, from Buxton in Derbyshire, and 19-year-old Vicky Balch, who is believed to be from Leyland in Lancashire, were also seriously injured.
Mr Thorpe is being treated at University Hospital Coventry where his condition is described as stable.
The other three victims are being treated at Royal Stoke University Hospital.

""Dan was taking a well earned day off following a busy weekend and it's awful to hear that what should have been a relaxing and fun day has ended in horror.
""Dan is an amazing friend and colleague who I have known for many years.  Dan is hugely popular and has many close work friends.  We are like a big family at The Izaak Walton and Dan's absence whilst he recovers from this awful ordeal will leave a huge hole here.
""Our thoughts and prayers are with Dan and the other passengers at this difficult time.""

1 billion
rides a year taken at fairgrounds & theme parks
1 death
in the UK since 2006/07
1.5 injuries per million rides in Europe each year
5% of accidents caused by technical problems
1 in 24m chance of being seriously hurt
Shares in Merlin Entertainments, which owns the theme park, have fallen just over 2.6% since the accident, wiping about Â£100m off its stock market value.
One analyst has estimated the park could be losing Â£500,000 for every day it stays closed.
Earlier, Alton Towers said it would remain shut on Friday while the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) continues its investigation.
A park spokesperson said anyone with pre-booked tickets would be able to visit Thorpe Park, Chessington World of Adventures, Warwick Castle or Legoland Windsor as an alternative.
Neil Craig, head of operations for HSE in the Midlands, said a specialist team of inspectors was making inquiries.
""Our role is to establish the facts,"" he said.
""We will want to determine that those responsible for operating this ride have done what the law requires.
""We will also ensure that if there are any lessons to be learned, they are shared as soon as possible.
""Although the investigation is in its early stages, we will take action to protect the public if we uncover evidence that could affect the safety of other rides at the park or elsewhere.""
Nick Varney, chief executive of Merlin Entertainments, said the park could reopen only when the investigation had concluded but did not give a time-frame.
Friends and relatives of those injured have been offering messages of support.
Natalie Kerr, Leah Washington's form tutor at Horizon Community College in Barnsley, said it was ""devastating"".
""I'm sure with Leah's determination and strength she'll get through this,"" she said.
""Best wishes go out to her.
""Leah was one of those pupils who is so genuine, she'll do anything for you. She has a smile on her face everyday. It's devastating for everyone especially the family. She's got good family around her so she's in good hands.
""Regardless of these injuries I think she'll go on to live the life of her dreams.""

"The Sana news agency said the military had ""restored security and stability to the neighbourhood of Khalidiya"".
Activists reported clashes in Khalidiya on Monday morning, but said that most of the area was under army control.
The announcement comes a month after troops launched an offensive to oust rebels from Syria's third largest city.
Homs has been one of the focuses of a two-year nationwide uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, in which the UN says more than 100,000 people have died.
Correspondents say the capture of Khalidiya would add further impetus to the counter-offensive by government troops and their allies, which saw the nearby town of Qusair fall in June.
By Paul WoodBBC News, Beirut
The fall of Khalidiya had been expected. One Western diplomat said he had been told recently by a Free Syrian Army commander that it was not possible to get any ammunition or other supplies in. Cut off from help, it was only a matter of time, perhaps, for the rebels.
There are other parts of Homs still, just, in rebel hands. But if they, along with Khalidiya, do fall, Homs will become just the latest in a line of regime victories on the battlefield.
The regime's forces have been steadily picking off some of the villages around Homs. Two months ago, with the help of Hezbollah, they recaptured the town of Qusair. The government has halted - if not quite turned around - a rebel advance on Damascus. Sources close to the regime say an offensive is also planned for the northern city of Aleppo.
After Khalidiya, Syria conflict goes on
In pictures: Khalidiya devastation
On Monday, an unnamed army officer told Syrian state television: ""Today, we can report having complete control of the area of Khalidiya.""
""That was a victory of all our fighters and the whole Syrian Army and especially our dear leader, Bashar al-Assad. And God willing, we will get rid of the terrorists in the entire country and the future will be free of killings and under the control of the army.""
However, UK-based activist group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights cast doubt on the claim.
While the group acknowledged that government forces were in control of most of Khalidiya, it said fighting was continuing on Monday.
""Clashes took place between rebels and regime forces, supported by Hezbollah and National Defence Forces, in the southern parts of the Khalidiya neighbourhood,"" it said.
""Regime forces are bombarding parts, and military reinforcements are arriving as advancing regime forces try to establish full control.""
Opposition activists told the AFP news agency that about 90% of Khalidiya was now controlled by the army. One told the Associated Press that the battle for the district was ""almost over"".
On Sunday, the Arabic TV station al-Mayadeen, which is seen as close to the Syrian government, broadcast what it said was footage of Khalidiya, showing heavily damaged buildings and piles of rubble.
It also showed pictures of the interior of the historic Khaled bin Walid mosque, a focal point for anti-government protesters. Troops reportedly seized it on Saturday, days after activists accused them of firing shells at the tomb of Khaled bin Walid, a revered figure in Islam.
Only the Old City of Homs and a few other districts are still held by the opposition. On Monday, government jets bombed the Bab Hud district of the Old City, just south of Khalidiya, according to the Syrian Observatory.","Syrian government forces have fully captured a district that was a key rebel stronghold in the central city of Homs, state media report.",23488855,"summary: Syrian government forces have fully captured a district that was a key rebel stronghold in the central city of Homs, state media report.","A)

"Shana Grice, 19, was found with her throat cut in her bedroom at her Brighton home in August 2016.
Her ex-boyfriend Michael Lane, 27, of Portslade, had placed a tracker device on her car, Lewes Crown Court heard.
Miss Grice contacted police several times about Lane's unwanted attention before she died. The police watchdog has begun an investigation.
A statement by her mother, Sharon Grice, read out in court by counsel, said: ""We firmly believe her murder could have been avoided if her fears had been taken seriously by police.
""Michael Lane had been harassing, stalking and pressurising her for over a year. Her life became a nightmare which we believe had affected her mental and physical health.
""The brutal death of our daughter has ruined our lives forever. We have become mere shells of our former selves.""
Speaking after the verdict, Deputy Chief Constable of Sussex Police, Bernie O'Reilly, said the force had apologised to the Grice family.
""When we looked at the circumstances leading to Shana's murder, we felt we may not have done the very best we could,"" he said.
During the two-week trial, Lane admitted he had stalked Miss Grice and had lied to police in interviews, but denied murder.
He had claimed he found her body and left her home without raising the alarm because he was in shock.
But the jury returned its guilty verdict after just over two hours of deliberation.
The court heard Lane refused to accept their break-up and was incensed when Miss Grice rekindled her relationship with ex-boyfriend Ashley Cooke, vowing to a friend: ""She'll pay for what she's done.""
Prosecutor Philip Bennetts QC said: ""During their relationship, he stalked her. He put a tracker on her car and followed her movements.
""That obsession with her translated into killing her. He would not allow anyone else to be with her.""
Two days before Miss Grice was killed, she met Lane at a hotel in Hove to insist their relationship was over, but Lane claimed they had sex earlier that day.
The evening before he killed her, he filled a red petrol can with fuel, but claimed he bought it to kill himself due to depression following his grandfather's death.
The car mechanic waited until she was alone at the bungalow she shared with two housemates before cutting her throat and trying to set fire to her room.
Prosecutors said one fire was started on the bed and another on the carpet, and Lane dismantled the smoke alarm in the hallway.
After the killing, Lane withdrew Â£60 from Miss Grice's bank account and went to check a lottery ticket before he went to work at SE Tyres in Burgess Hill, where he was arrested.
He is due to be sentenced on Thursday.
Mr Justice Green warned Lane he faces a life sentence with a ""very substantial minimum term"".
During the trial, the the court heard Miss Grice complained about her ex-boyfriend to police several times.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is conducting an investigation into the contact between Miss Grice, Mr Lane and Sussex Police in the lead-up to her death.
Mr O'Reilly said: ""Within days of her murder I personally visited Shana's family to apologise on behalf of Sussex Police and we made a referral to the IPCC.
""We have thoroughly reviewed all aspects of how we deal with cases of stalking and harassment and we have now taken on the learning and our approach is more robust.""
An IPCC spokesman said investigators had already interviewed a number of witnesses and further interviews would be carried out now the trial had finished.",A man who stalked and killed his former girlfriend after she rejected him has been found guilty of her murder.,39355895,summary: A man who stalked and killed his former girlfriend after she rejected him has been found guilty of her murder.,"A)

England only needed a draw to finish top of the group and after a lacklustre first half, Nikita Parris set them on the way to victory after the break.
The striker headed home Karen Carney's cross to give England the lead.
England dominated thereafter and Carney doubled the visitors' advantage with a strike which took a heavy deflection.
Jade Moore won the ball and released Carney who neatly beat one defender on the edge of the box before scoring with a strike which went in via Lorca van de Putte.
It was a victory which extended England's unbeaten run to seven matches, with the past five of those ending in victories. The Lionesses last lost a competitive qualifier in November 2002.
England had already qualified for next summer's tournament in the Netherlands thanks to the 5-0 thumping of Estonia on 15 September, but England boss Mark Sampson said before the match in Leuven that he was determined his team would end the qualifiers as group leaders.
Belgium, the only team to have taken a point off Sampson's side during the campaign, could have finished top of Group 7 had they beaten England, but they never truly came close and must settle for second spot.
Neither team impressed in a first half full of stray passes and pedestrian attacks. England's best chance fell to Lucy Bronze, whose long-range effort was a fraction wide from the top corner.
Belgium also had an opportunity to break the deadlock and would probably have scored through a Tessa Wullaert in-swinging corner had Jill Scott not headed the danger away.
Belgium were organised in defence and for most of the match were quick to close down playmaker Karen Carney whenever she received the ball, reducing her influence in the final third and consequently nullifying England.
But on the rare occasions Belgium did give Carney space to pull England's strings, the Chelsea forward was ruthless. First, she floated a lovely cross towards the industrious Parris to score her third international goal and followed up with five minutes remaining with a strike which completely wrong-footed Justien Odeurs thanks to the deflection.
Sampson has proved he is not afraid to make changes - tweaking the formation during this campaign and making two changes to the team which beat Estonia, with Siobhan Chamberlain and Gemma Davison replaced by Karen Bardsley and Gilly Flaherty.
But it was the introduction of Moore that changed the course of this match, with the midfielder breaking up play and giving the visitors more ballast in midfield.

"The party's NEC said it had voted by a ""clear majority"" to exclude Mr Woolfe - previously seen as the frontrunner.
The MEP said he was ""extremely disappointed"" by the decision, and three NEC members have quit in protest.
Jonathan Arnott, Bill Etheridge, Diane James, Lisa Duffy, Phillip Broughton and Elizabeth Jones are on the ballot.
Speaking to the BBC, Mr Woolfe said he believed the NEC had ""their own reasons"" for excluding him from the ballot, but implied it could have been linked to the fact he was committed to abolishing the executive.
Asked if he would consider taking legal action, or calling a vote of no confidence in the NEC, Mr Woolfe said it was a matter for the party membership but he thought the contest should continue without him.
Announcing their resignations from the NEC, Victoria Ayling, Raymond Finch and Michael McGough said in a joint statement that the party's governing body ""is no longer fit for purpose"" and called for a vote of no confidence in the NEC.
They accused it of ""deliberately obstructing"" Mr Woolfe and some of its members of putting personal ambitions ahead of the interests of the party - which polled more than four million votes at the last general election and got 12% of the vote.
""Steven Woolfe is a popular candidate among UKIP's members and should be permitted to represent those that wish to vote for him,"" they wrote.
""To purposefully trawl for technicalities upon which to base a decision to deny his inclusion is not in the best interests of the membership and truly injurious to UKIP.""
The winner of the leadership contest - sparked by Mr Farage's decision to stand down after the UK voted to leave the EU - is scheduled to be announced on 15 September.
In a statement announcing the final line-up, the party said: ""By a clear majority of NEC members Steven Woolfe MEP's application was considered to be ineligible as a result of a late submission and as such he did not meet the eligibility criteria.""
Mr Woolfe, the party's immigration spokesman, submitted his nomination papers 17 minutes late on Sunday, blaming the delay on technical issues with the registration site.
He submitted his application at 11:35 BST - before the noon deadline - but it did not successfully go through until 12:17 BST.
He said he had been in contact with party officials prior to the deadline passing to alert them to the problems, and had sent pictures, upon request, to prove it.
The party's chairman, Paul Oakden, said Mr Woolfe's exclusion was ""regrettable"" but the rules for prospective candidates, as for all elections, were ""very clear"".
He told BBC Radio 4's World at One that the NEC was put in the position of having ""to bend and flex the rules"" to accommodate a single candidate and ""I think they did not feel comfortable in doing that"".
Mr Woolfe said he was ""extremely disappointed"" not to be on the final ballot as he had wanted to ""inject my ideas, plans and passion into the party"".
And he criticised the NEC as ""not fit for purpose"" and said its conduct during the leadership election had ""confirmed many member's fears that it is neither effective nor professional in the way it governs the party"".
""They have failed to accept that there were serious issues with the application system despite providing evidence that attempts of submission were made before the deadline. The NEC deny this is the fault of the UKIP system.
""Furthermore, highly confidential information about me held in party documents has been leaked to the press and the NEC has not sought to investigate this gross breach of privacy,"" he added.
Mr McGough - who has resigned from the NEC - said Mr Woolfe's exclusion from the contest was ""unfair"" and called into the question the party's future.
Unless the party elected a ""competent leader who was comfortable with the media, it was finished"", he told World at One. ""This is a fight for survival. It is life or death.""
BBC political correspondent Tom Bateman said the NEC's decision ""opens up a whole new schism in UKIP"" and he understood that Mr Farage could call an emergency meeting of the party membership to put pressure on the body to reconsider.
Mr Oakden, who only took over as party chairman this week, said the party was perfectly entitled to call an EGM if 25% of its branches backed the move but said talk of a potential split was over-exaggerated and the remaining contenders were a diverse and exciting group.
MEP Ms James - now regarded as the favourite in the contest - has launched her own campaign website while Mr Arnott, an MEP for the north east of England, has said he was won the backing of the party's deputy leader Paul Nuttall.
Of the other candidates, Mr Etheridge is also a member of European Parliament while Lisa Duffy is a councillor in Cambridgeshire. Both Ms Jones and Mr Broughton have stood as candidates in recent parliamentary elections.","UKIP leadership hopeful Steven Woolfe has been ruled ""ineligible"" to stand in the contest to replace Nigel Farage - after he submitted his papers late.",36962266,"summary: UKIP leadership hopeful Steven Woolfe has been ruled ""ineligible"" to stand in the contest to replace Nigel Farage - after he submitted his papers late.","A)

""CJ McGourty led by example with pressure frees and we got over the line - we must push on now.""
There was a dramatic opening at the Gaelic Grounds with Forker red-carded after 50 seconds followed by McKeever's goal and the exit of Williams on 10 minutes.
The Orchard visitors made a blistering start, surging to a 2-3 to 0-1 lead with Rowland firing in the second goal.
Louth pair Paraic Smith and Ryan Burns each scored three first-half points and the Division Three pacesetters trailed 2-5 to 0-6 at the break.
Armagh banged over seven of the opening eight points at the start of second half to kill off Louth hopes.
Grimley split the posts twice to take his tally to five points and three came from Clarke, who also converted a late penalty.
Armagh are third but just a point behind Louth and new leaders Tipperary.

"The initial plan was to pass ownership to supporters' group Well Society in five years, but instead it has taken 14 months for the handover to be agreed.
This was always going to be the final outcome, since Hutchison was never interested in owning or running the club long-term.
For him, a Lanarkshire boy whose business career took him abroad and eventually into a life of significant wealth, the point was to contribute to his local community.
Challenges remain, though, even if Hutchison believes much of the hard work has been carried out.
The significant progress is that costs have been cut, that investments have been made on infrastructure projects at Fir Park and on improving the chances of the football side of the business contributing to self-sustainability.
Hutchison is satisfied that in agreeing to sell his 76% shareholding for £1 to the Well Society, he has paved the way for stability and fan ownership.
If there is a message from Hutchison, it is that fans and local businesses need to step up to support the club financially, so that it never needs to be reliant on wealthy individuals or investors.
""I can't speak to the future of any business, whether it's secure or otherwise, but if they have enough customers and they follow the strategy which has been implemented, we've significantly improved the probability of success,"" Hutchison told BBC Scotland from his home in Barbados.
""[The club] is extremely close [to break even]. In recent months, the player budget has been reduced dramatically, we've been able to sign some really excellent younger players on longer-term contracts, which reduces costs because you don't have to buy a much more experienced player, we've significantly reduced the medical bills by the introduction of the sports scientist.
""We could do with a little bit of a boost on the commercial side, but we have that pipeline of young talent coming through which would give the opportunity for additional transfer income.
""What [supporters] need to do is decide whether or not they want to try to make it work and whether they want to step up.
""The second, and probably more important one, is that I'd like to see more local companies participate more effectively with the club and the community.""
Hutchison had to address costs at Fir Park since the club was running at a loss.
Before John Boyle's controlling interest was transferred in January 2015, Hutchison had to provide £30,000 to pay bills. He has since invested £650,000 and £380,000 in loans, with at least £180,000 having been paid back, and the remaining repayment terms altered.
Motherwell previously used to budget to finish in the top half of the Premiership, which meant that any drop in form had a significant impact on working capital.
That has changed, while 10 players left the club in January, although one of them - James McFadden - subsequently signed a new short-term deal until the end of the season.
Under Mark McGhee's management, the focus is to be on developing young players, and Hutchison is particularly proud that under his tenure, Motherwell have reached the youth cup final for the first time in 30 years.
The challenge, though, is financial as well as sporting. The income streams of football clubs rise and fall over the course of a season, but there is now no wealthy individual on hand to cover any shortfalls that might arise.
The Well Society's membership has plateaued, with some letting their subscriptions slide. The Society needs all of its members to be contributing and for more to join if money is to be raised to support the fan-ownership model.
""People got into a bit of a comfort zone that maybe they don't have to participate, 'it's okay, Les is here, don't worry about it',"" Hutchison said.
""From the very outset, I wasn't in the business of wanting to own or run a football club in Scotland, I am a philanthropist and I was trying to help the community.
""The Society have had up to 1700 people who have at some point in time contributed. All it takes is for people who have done it in the past to do it again and a few more, with also the support of local business who really want to support their local communities and customers, they need to step up a bit more as well.
""If that happens, then the thing will be in good hands.
""What [the club] has to do is manage the cash flow. That's the challenge. The cash comes in in peaks and troughs because of the way the league does their financing and the way that sponsors pay their money, and TV and so on.
""If they could build up some reasonable reserves, they can then manage through the peaks and troughs.
""We've been budgeting quite prudently. We've had to take actions to make sure those budgets can be achieved. It all bodes well at this point.""
Hutchison has stabilised Motherwell - at a personal cost of £1m - and has now left the supporters with the opportunity, and the challenge, of taking over. For that to happen, the Well Society will need to succeed in a way that it hasn't been able to achieve in the past.",Les Hutchison's involvement at Motherwell has ended before he expected it to.,35826768,summary: Les Hutchison's involvement at Motherwell has ended before he expected it to.,"A)

"The 10-part Channel 4 and Sony Pictures Television series, based on Dick's short stories, will star Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston.
Other writers on the project include Matthew Graham (Doctor Who) and 50 Shades screenwriter Kelly Marcel.
Filming is expected to begin early next year.
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas writer Tony Grisoni is also one of the scriptwriters on board.
The new writers were revealed at a dinner ahead of the Edinburgh International Television Festival.
Each episode of Electric Dreams will be a standalone piece, adapted by a team of authors which also includes Masters of Sex's Michael Dinner and Outlander's Ronald D Moore.
Dick, who died in 1982 at the age of 53, had 44 novels published. His first was Solar Lottery in 1955.
He is best known for works including The Man in the High Castle and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? - the basis of 1982 film Blade Runner.
Other films based on Dick's books include Total Recall and Minority Report. He also wrote more than 100 short stories.
Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, the West End stage play written by Thorne, is set 19 years after the seventh and final book in the series by JK Rowling.
Presented in two parts and running to more than five hours, it shows the main characters from the books as adults in their mid-30s as their own children head off to Hogwarts.
Demand for tickets for the two-part show has been huge. The show is sold out, although there is an online lottery every Friday in which 40 tickets are released for every performance the following week.
Thorne's other TV credits include two Bafta-winning series, This is England and The Fades.

"Edward Alexander Lee, 34, was sentenced to three years on probation at Belfast Crown Court on Wednesday.
Judge Gordon Kerr QC said it was the best way of protecting society and helping Lee to change his ways.
Lee, originally from Whitehall Square, Belfast, but now living in England, pleaded guilty to a total of 15 charges related to child pornography.
The court was told the vast majority of the images were in the lowest categories, although some were in the higher - more serious - categories.
Lee was described by his wife as a being ""loving and normal young man"".
Judge Kerr said that while he had viewed the images for his ""own strange pleasure"", they were serious matters as ""children were abused for these images to be made"".
He added that children would continue to be abused while people like Lee continued to view such material, and that ""society would not tolerate such behaviour"".
Judge Kerr said a sentence of up to a year in prison would do very little to assist Lee or the community.
Placing him on probation, he ordered him to complete a course on sexual offending to help him stop viewing such images.
Earlier, prosecutor Simon Jenkins said that when police went to Lee's then Belfast home on 5 June, 2014, he immediately confirmed he was the man they were looking for.
On computer equipment seized, police uncovered a number of folders, which Lee admitted creating.
During interview, Lee said that he had been downloading images ""for perhaps the last nine years"".
Defence lawyer Taylor Campbell said that Lee had admitted his guilt from the outset, pleading guilty at arraignment, and was entirely frank and co-operative with police.","A man, who downloaded thousands of images of children being sexually abused, has been released on probation.",36207710,"summary: A man, who downloaded thousands of images of children being sexually abused, has been released on probation.","A)

"Another 30 on the bus were hurt and two of them were fighting for their lives.
The bus was carrying a group of German pensioners at the time of the fire near Stammbach in northern Bavaria.
Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said rescuers were delayed by ""gawpers"" driving slowly and by the intensity of the blaze.
The cause of the fire is unknown. Traffic was reportedly moving slowly at the time and the collision between the two vehicles was not described as a major crash.
The lorry's trailer was also incinerated and the burnt-out wreck ended up a short distance ahead of the bus. The German news website Frankenpost reports that it was carrying mattresses and pillows.
The lorry driver was unharmed and told police the bus had gone into the back of his vehicle and burst into flames, it said.
There were 46 passengers and two drivers on the bus. The bus driver was among those killed. The passengers were men and women aged 66 to 81, heading to Lake Garda in Italy for a holiday.
Some of the passengers had got on the bus at Dresden station in the eastern state of Saxony. According to local media in Saxony, the bus had earlier picked up passengers elsewhere in Saxony and also in Brandenburg in the early hours of Monday before going to Dresden and then south-west towards Nuremberg.
By mid-afternoon forensic teams had recovered the charred remains of 15 people and police confirmed that 18 had died.
Firefighters reached the scene within 10 minutes of the accident but were driven back by the intensity of the fire. ""Only steel parts are recognisable so you can understand what that meant for the people in this bus,"" said German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt.
Motoring safety expert Hans-Ulrich Sander suggested that the fuel line that ran under the bus may have ruptured, prompting the fire to spread fast.
Five rescue helicopters joined emergency workers at the scene.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was distressed by the accident and expressed sympathy for the injured and bereaved relatives.
She thanked the rescuers for looking after people ""in an appalling situation"".","Eighteen people died when their tour bus collided with a lorry and burst into flames on the A9 motorway in southern Germany, police say.",40479021,"summary: Eighteen people died when their tour bus collided with a lorry and burst into flames on the A9 motorway in southern Germany, police say.","A)

"Vokes is now tied to the Turf Moor club until the end of the 2018-19 season.
""My massive goal is to do well at club level and play at the Euros in the summer,"" Vokes told BBC Radio Wales.
The 26-year-old, who has six goals in 37 games for his country, has been with the Clarets since joining from Wolves in July 2012.
He has scored 31 goals in 137 appearances in all competitions for Burnley, with a total of 64 in 300 career games.
He has netted five times in 27 games for Sean Dyche's side this season.
""It's great to put pen to paper, I've been very happy at Burnley, it's a club I've found a home at in the last few years,"" he said.
""We are concentrating on pushing for promotion and that was a massive factor in signing the new deal, the belief I have in the club.
""Promotion is a big aim and I think we've got the squad to do that.""
A spot in Chris Coleman's 23-man squad for Wales' first major football tournament since 1958 this summer is another priority.
""I'm not guaranteed a spot, it's never a given or something I'd take for granted. You need to be playing well for your club to be picked for your country,"" Vokes added.
""I need to do well this season and that gives me the best chance of going to France and forcing my way into the team.""
Vokes' 2014-15 campaign was hampered by a cruciate ligament injury but has suffered no problems since having surgery.
""Three-and-a-half more years shows faith from the club in me and they stood by me with my injury,"" he said.

"There were about 19,000 diagnoses in 2015, compared to about 17,300 in 2006.
Public Health Wales (PHW) said the main reason for the increase was an ageing population.
The organisation's Dr Dyfed Wyn Huws said there was ""good news"" by way of significant reductions in smoking rates in recent decades.
There was a year-on-year decrease from about 19,800 cases in 2014, but the 2015 figure of 19,088 is likely to increase as statisticians revise the numbers.
Once age factors are taken into account, the rate decreased by more than 5% in men, but increased by more than 5% among women between 2006 and 2015.
This is partly due to the rate of lung cancer going down in men, but up among women. Historically, smoking rates peaked far earlier among men than women.
Breast, prostate, lung and bowel cancers remain the most common.
According to PHW, cases of liver, mouth, throat and melanoma skin cancer saw the biggest percentage increases.
The rates of stomach cancer and prostate cancer decreased, while mesothelioma rates increased by almost a third.
Dr Huws said: ""We know that up to four in 10 of cancers in the population may be preventable.
""With an increasing number of cancer cases each year, cancer control is possible and important for future generations and for keeping rising health service demand in check.
""The good news is that we have seen significant reductions in smoking rates in recent decades.

"Prof Simon Wessely, said he was ""genuinely surprised and incredibly honoured"" by the award.
He now heads the department of psychological medicine at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College, London.
He became interested in ""medically unexplained symptoms and syndromes"" early in his career, and studied chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) - or ME.
In 1991 he was involved in setting up one of the first NHS clinics for people with CFS symptoms and in the mid 1990s, he started to investigate Gulf War Syndrome.
This disputed condition had been linked to personnel who served in the first Gulf conflict in 1990-91.
Reported symptoms ranged from chronic fatigue, headaches and sleep disturbances to joint pains, irritable bowel, stomach and respiratory disorders and psychological problems.
Prof Wessely has said there may not be a distinct illness.
He said: ""Gulf War Syndrome is a misnomer,"" he said. ""Rather it's an illness or health effect.
""We established something happened, but we found no specific cause.
""The fascinating thing is that it didn't happen again in Iraq, and the reason for that remains enigmatic.""
Prof Wessely continues to study the long-term effects on those now serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But he said that there had been improvements in the mental health care for armed forces personnel and those close to them.
""There is now improved psychological support, particularly for reservists and families.""
He was among a large number of researchers, charity workers and NHS staff to receive honours.
Other health experts recognised included Stephen O'Brien, Chair of Barts and The London NHS Trust, who also receives a knighthood.

"Following the revelations of inappropriate relationships, the home affairs select committee has called for an urgent review of laws governing undercover policing.
Here are the women's accounts of how they felt when it emerged that their relationships, which lasted from two to six years, were based on deception. These are not their real names.
""I was absolutely shocked and devastated,"" she told MPs.
Lisa had a six-year relationship with former PC Mark Kennedy, who posed as long-haired dropout Mark ""Flash"" Stone to infiltrate a group of environmental protesters.
""You imagine that somebody may be in public meetings that environmental groups have. You imagine there might be somebody listening in there. You could even imagine that your phone might be tapped or that somebody might look at your emails.
""But to know that there was somebody in your bed for six years, that somebody was involved in your family life to such a degree, that was an absolute shock.
""Well, 'shock' is an understatement. It felt like the ground had shifted beneath me and my sense of what was reality and what wasn't was completely turned on its head.""
During the hearing she was asked whether she had any sympathy for Mr Kennedy, who is suing the Metropolitan Police claiming he had been traumatised by what had happened.
""As a human being it is very difficult not to have sympathy for somebody that I cared about deeply, but it is also important to remember that that person that I cared about deeply did not in fact exist,"" she replied.
She adds that she still has questions about what happened.
""Who was listening in to our most intimate phone calls? Who saw our holiday photos? Was there anybody following us when we were on holiday?
""Who made the decisions about what happened to my life, where I was allowed to go, who I was allowed to see, which I thought was my free will but actually was being manipulated by this person who was being controlled by other people?""
""We weren't married, clearly, but we shared the same flat. He was completely integrated into my life for five years and then one day he disappeared,"" she said.
Alison had a relationship with a man she knew as Mark Cassidy, who she met through a group she was involved with in 1994. But he was in fact an undercover police officer. She told MPs the revelation had an ""enormous impact"" on her life.
""The experience has left me with many, many unanswered questions, and one of those that comes back is: how much of the relationship was real?,"" she told MPs.
""Some of the consequences of that have meant that I have, for the last 13 years, questioned my own judgment and it has impacted seriously on my ability to trust, and that has impacted on my current relationship and other subsequent relationships.
Alison, a peaceful campaigner involved in left-wing political causes, believes she inadvertently provided him with ""an excellent cover story"", helping persuade other activists he was genuine.
She said he became totally integrated into her family, appearing in her mother's wedding photograph, accompanying her on holidays and supporting her through the bereavement of a close friend.
""This is not about just a lying boyfriend or a boyfriend who has cheated on you. It is not even about a boyfriend who is having another relationship with somebody else. It is about a fictional character who was created by the state and funded by taxpayers' money.""
""You do not know who you can trust any more. It destroys everything,"" she said.
When the boyfriend Clare knew as John Barker disappeared two years into their relationship, she was determined to track him down. She found a death certificate for his name, and discovered he had been using the identity of a child who had died of leukaemia aged eight.
She visited the child's house, but their parents no longer lived there.
""He had told me that his parents were dead when we were in a relationship, so I wasn't expecting to see the parents, but I thought that if I went there... he had been a missing person for however long and I was desperate to find him. I was really concerned about his welfare,"" she explained.
""Nothing made sense of what had happened, and so I went there desperate, thinking I have to follow every clue that I have, and I thought maybe some other members of the family may still live there or somebody might know where he was.""
She said people trying to justify the practice saying things like it prevented terrorism, was very distressing.
""This is not about a need to do it. It is about a desire to do it. They have the power and they think they can get away with it. That is what it is about.
""It is deeply distressing, and I do not think it should be allowed in any circumstances. It is so intrusive into people's lives, and, as my friends have said, it turns your life upside down.
""Everything that you thought you knew suddenly becomes unreal; everything changes,"" she said.",The stories of women who were unknowingly involved in relationships with undercover police officers are revealed as their testimonies to MPs are made public.,21629991,summary: The stories of women who were unknowingly involved in relationships with undercover police officers are revealed as their testimonies to MPs are made public.,"A)

"Brentford goalkeeper Daniel Bentley saved Aluko's initial shot but the winger followed up from close range to give Fulham a deserved half-time lead.
The Bees did not register a single shot on goal in the first period.
Ex-Brentford keeper David Button superbly saved Josh Clarke's effort before Cairney slotted in Fulham's second on the break in stoppage time.
A win for Dean Smith's Bees would have taken them into the play-off places before Saturday's Championship fixtures, but they failed to find the net for the fourth time in six league games.
Instead, they were leapfrogged by a Fulham side that is only outside the top six on goal difference.
Fulham, who had scored 11 times in their previous four Championship matches, should have been further ahead by the interval.
Full-backs Scott Malone and Ryan Fredericks were constant attacking threats but some wayward finishing let the visitors down, while Bentley rescued Brentford with saves from Stefan Johansen and Cairney.
Brentford struggled to seriously test Button too often on his return to Griffin Park following his summer move to Craven Cottage.
He made an excellent one-handed stop to deny Clarke an equaliser and Fulham survived a number of scrambles from set-pieces before Cairney's calmly-taken goal sealed victory.
Brentford boss Dean Smith told BBC Radio London:
""We didn't perform well and didn't deserve to win. We knew they would come and press us but our use of the ball was not good enough.
""In the second half our midfielders had to get on the ball higher up the pitch and we were better.
""While not playing at our best, we showed some spirit and stayed in the game until the 93rd minute.""
Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic told BBC Radio London:
""I am very happy. We showed another positive step and our progress. We tried to show our identity and our style and I am very satisfied for my lads and the Fulham fans.
""We didn't win in the last four games against Brentford and this is a nice present for people around us.
""We are in a learning process and want to be better.""

"The advert for its invisible deodorant range said ""white is purity"" across an image of a woman.
It was posted on the firm's Facebook page, geographically aimed at its followers in the Middle East. Nivea accepted the post was ""misleading"".
Many on social media complained the post was racist, but it was also widely-shared among alt-right users.
The advert on the Nivea Facebook page (since deleted) was posted alongside the caption: ""Keep it clean, keep it bright. Don't let anything ruin it.""
The post was directed at its audience in the Middle East, although the company has 19 million fans globally on its page.
Many on social media complained about the post's racist connotations.
But it was also picked up by alt-right social media accounts who trolled the Nivea account with comments, including of Hitler and Pepe the frog, who was branded a hate symbol last year.
One alt-right account said: ""#Nivea: the official moisturizer/anti-perspirant of the #AltRight.""

"The new boathouse, which will replace the existing building on Foreshore Road, will be home to a new £2m Shannon class lifeboat.
The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) said building work would begin in autumn and take a year to finish.
Plans were approved by Scarborough Borough Council's planning and development committee.
RNLI divisional operations manager Andrew Ashton said: ""We're delighted that the plans have been approved today and this heralds an exciting new era in Scarborough RNLI's rich and long lifesaving history.""
The lifeboat station will be funded from various RNLI sources including legacies, donations and fundraising activities.
The Shannon class lifeboat will replace Scarborough's current Mersey class lifeboat in 2016.
John Senior, Scarborough RNLI lifeboat operations manager, said: ""While it will be a shame to say a fond farewell to our existing facilities, which have served us admirably over the decades, it's time to look to the future.""

"Syrian state media says toxic gas was contained in shells that rebels have been firing at government-held areas in the divided city.
Russian news agency Interfax says seven people died and more than 20 were hospitalised after Tuesday's attack.
There has been no independent confirmation of the claim.
It comes after reports from a rebel-held town in Idlib province that chlorine gas was dropped on it late on Monday after a Russian military helicopter had earlier been shot down nearby.
A battle has continued since the weekend in Aleppo, as rebels attempt to break a government siege of a rebel-controlled area.
It is expected to be decisive for the future of a city that was once a commercial heartland but has been destroyed by five years of war.
About a quarter of a million civilians are living under siege since government forces cut them off last month.
The latest reports from the area are that the government, backed by Russian jets, has regained some ground. It is not clear exactly which territory has returned to government control but a reporter for a Beirut-based TV station said the army had regained control of two out of three villages that it lost near Aleppo earlier this week.
Russian and Syrian forces say they have been operating seven so-called humanitarian corridors, allowing hundreds of people to leave the besieged area peacefully.
On Wednesday, Russian state television ran pictures of civilians and fighters leaving. Smoke was seen billowing over the city in the footage, and gunshots were heard.
The UN's Children's Fund (Unicef) said it is ""extremely"" concerned for the safety of children caught up in violence in the city.
Saad Houry, of the fund, said children make up a third of the population trapped in the siege, and called for unhindered humanitarian access and for children to be protected.
The New York-based Physicians for Human Rights group said the last week of July was the worst week for attacks on medical facilities in the region since the Syrian war began in 2011. In a statement, the group said it has verified six deadly air strikes against hospitals in Aleppo governorate, all perpetrated by Syrian government forces.
Widney Brown of Physicians for Human Rights said: ""Destroying hospitals is tantamount to signing thousands of death warrants for people now stranded in eastern Aleppo.""","The Russian military says it has informed the US that it believes rebels in the Syrian city of Aleppo have deployed ""toxic substances"".",36970220,"summary: The Russian military says it has informed the US that it believes rebels in the Syrian city of Aleppo have deployed ""toxic substances"".","A)

"Unions at BAE Systems have warned of possible delays to funding for the Royal Navy's new frigates.
But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson insisted there was no change to the timetable.
Labour said it was vital that promises were kept while the Lib Dems called for an end to uncertainty.
The UK government confirmed in its Strategic Defence and Security Review last November that eight Type 26 frigates would be built on the Clyde, although the total number was scaled back from 13.
In the meantime, the yards are being sustained by Ministry of Defence orders for new offshore patrol vessels.
But after briefings with management, the GMB union said last week that work on the new frigates would not begin until 2017 and raised concerns that up to 800 jobs could be lost if there was any backsliding on commitments.
SNP leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""gravely concerned"" by the developments.
She said: ""The future of both Govan and Scotstoun depend on these orders. Solemn promises were made in the run-up to the referendum and if those promises are broken, it will be seriously damaging for the shipyards but I think people across Scotland will feel very let down by the parties that made those promises.""
She added: ""I think the government has the responsibility to make cast iron assurances here.""
Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said she had held discussions with shipyard workers and BAE management  about the need to protect jobs.
She said: ""It's my deep regret that Labour didn't win the general election - so the Tories have to fulfil their promise to the workers in the yards, and I'll be making that case every step of the way.""
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie also expressed frustration about the uncertainty.
""There are serious concerns about the future of orders at the yards and it's important that the Conservative government gives an absolute commitment. We've got to end this feast and famine of orders at the yards,"" he said.
The Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, however, said she had been given assurances by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon that nothing had changed.
She said: ""He confirmed there had been no change to the orders that were set out in the Strategic Defence and Security Review last year.
""That means all eight Type 26 anti-submarine frigates that are coming, plus the light frigate order on top of that, and the two offshore patrol vessels. They are coming to the Clyde, as discussed last year, to the same timetable and the same number.""
A spokesperson for BAE Systems said: ""Following the Strategic Defence and Security Review, we are working with the Ministry of Defence to agree a revised baseline for the Type 26 ships and a production schedule for the two additional offshore patrol vessels in Glasgow.
""We are engaging our trades unions as we work through this process.

Ding scored at least a half-century in every frame he won as he extended his first-session lead from 6-2 to 10-2.
Williams, who had to play with a new tip after splitting his old one on Monday, managed to pot just two balls before the mid-session interval.
The Welshman did take frame 13, but China's Ding powered to victory.
Two-time Crucible champion Williams only made two half-centuries, but said he was destined to lose from the moment he split his old tip.
""I got beat easily and, to be honest, deep down I knew I would so I cannot really grumble,"" said Williams, 41.
""I was playing, and feeling, brilliant. With the players left in, it was probably my best chance of winning the World Championship.
""But as soon as my tip split the night before I knew then that my chances were gone. It was almost impossible. It didn't matter who I played.
""He played good but in the first session, I feel, if I had my normal tip I would have been in front.""
Ding still had to take his opportunities and he did so in devastating style.
Williams was so accustomed to sitting in his chair during a one-sided start to the evening session, that Ding had to remind his opponent to get up and go in for a break.
The Welshman then joked that he had Ding ""rattled"" and his ""head had gone"" when he tweeted during the interlude.
Ding, who last reached the semi-finals in 2011, has dropped down to 17 in the world and had to qualify for this year's tournament.
But the 29-year-old looked to be reaping the reward of so much time in play during a one-sided morning session where he was sharp and fluent in taking six from seven frames after Williams won the opener.
And he sealed victory with little fuss, grabbing his 11th score of more than 50 on his way.
""I got some easy chances in the match because Mark had a lot of bad kicks,"" Ding said. ""And every player has a big problem if they have a new tip.
""I controlled the game, took my chances and made some good breaks. I was confident. Every time I saw a chance I thought I could go for it and pot it.""
In the evening's other match, world number one Mark Selby maintained his four-frame advantage over gutsy qualifier Kyren Wilson to lead 10-6 with a session to play.
Wilson, who beat top-10 seeds Joe Perry and Mark Allen to reach the last eight, had chances in the first three frames but lost them all as the 2014 champion Selby built a 6-0 lead.
The Kettering man responded by taking the next two and then won a scrappy ninth frame of a disjointed match to get to within three.
But Selby's famed matchplay saw him keep his rival at bay and he won a tense final frame to avoid his lead being reduced to two frames.

"The UK stage of the race comes to the city on 7 July.
Cycling enthusiast Rad Wagon is recruiting people to knit 3,000 miniature ""Tour jerseys"" and wool-covered bicycle wheels.
Schools and knitting groups have already offered to start knitting and the council was ""interested"", he said.
A similar ""mini-jersey"" idea is being promoted by Harrogate Borough Council for the Yorkshire stage of the race.
The public response to that was so overwhelming the council had to ask people not to send any more knitting to them.
""It's a bit copycat but we can do so much more,"" Mr Wagon said.
""The city's well-known for its knitters and 'yarn bombers' who cover everything from bikes to trees to lamp-posts. It's 'very Cambridge'.
""I think knitting is in Cambridge's DNA,"" he added.
Mr Wagon, a cycling skills and bicycle maintenance trainer from Outspoken Training in the city, said he was a fan not only of the Tour de France, but the cultural activities surrounding it.
""It isn't just a bike race. Its history is all about promoting your town and region and that's something we can do.
""The world's eyes will be on us and it's a chance for us to show that Cambridge can do things slightly differently, and perhaps slightly oddly,"" he said.
A knitting shop owner has offered to give knitting lessons and collect the tiny pullovers, Mr Wagon said.
A cycle shop in the city has also offered a collection of battered wheels which Mr Wagon hopes can also be turned into knitted decorations.

Dywedodd un sy'n aelod o Croeso Arberth, Christina Hughes, wrth raglen Eye on Wales ar BBC Radio Wales nad oedd hi'n gallu ""eistedd nôl a gwylio pobl yn dioddef"".
Felly daeth criw o bobl leol at ei gilydd i sefydlu'r grŵp, sy'n cymryd cyfrifoldeb o hyd at dri theulu drwy ddarparu cartref ar eu cyfer a'u helpu i ddysgu Saesneg er mwyn dod o hyd i waith.
Mae ffigyrau yn dangos bod grwpiau cymunedol o'r fath wedi cefnogi hyd at 53 ffoadur y llynedd.
Ond mae Croeso Arberth yn pryderu bod y broses yn un cymhleth.
Roedd yn rhaid iddyn nhw gasglu £4,500 ar gyfer yswiriant ar gyfer y saith ffoadur maen nhw'n eu cefnogi, yn ogystal â chadw £6,000 mewn cyfrif i dalu am gyfieithwyr a chostau teithio.
Mae £200 yn cael ei gadw 'nôl hefyd fel lwfans i aelodau o'r teulu.
""Dyma oedd dechrau'r broses gyda nifer o ffurflenni gan y Swyddfa Gartref i'w llenwi,"" meddai Ms Hughes.
""Doedd gennai ddim syniad faint o waith oedd yn ei gymryd. Hanner ffordd drwy'r broses roeddwn yn gofyn i fy hun 'be dwi'n ei wneud?'
""Ond dwi'n falch fy mod wedi bwrw 'mlaen.""
Dyma beth sydd i ddisgwyl gan gymunedau sy'n noddi ffoaduriaid:
Roedd rhaid i'r grŵp gael caniatâd gan Gyngor Sir Benfro cyn bwrw 'mlaen gyda'r cais i ddarparu cymorth i'r ffoaduriaid, yn ogystal â Citizens UK.
Bellach mae'r broses ar ben ac mae teulu o saith ffoadur o Syria wedi cyrraedd Arberth.
""Allai ddim credu bod y cyfan drosodd,"" meddai Ms Hughes.
""Gan ein bod yn un o'r grwpiau cyntaf i gyflawni hyn dwi'n gobeithio wrth fynd ymlaen bydd y Swyddfa Gartref yn gwneud pethau'n gynt i grwpiau eraill.""",Wrth i'r swyddfa gartref gyhoeddi £1m i helpu cymunedau noddi ffoaduriaid mae pryder ynglŷn â pha mor gymhleth yw'r broses.,40673606,summary: Wrth i'r swyddfa gartref gyhoeddi £1m i helpu cymunedau noddi ffoaduriaid mae pryder ynglŷn â pha mor gymhleth yw'r broses.,"A)

"However, the 2018 event, set to showcase art, design and innovation, will not be the first in the region.
In 1929, the North East Coast Exhibition was opened by the Prince of Wales in Newcastle amid great fanfare.
So, will organisers take inspiration from the grand event, which attracted four million visitors?
Responding to the Newcastle and Gateshead announcement, the North East Chamber of Commerce said: ""The Great Exhibition looks set to be the launch pad of real growth in our regional economy.""
The Prince of Wales - later King Edward VIII - opened the 1929 event and said: ""The industries of the North are not yet knocked out of the ring.
""They are fighting back gallantly with a good Northern punch.""
And the ""northern punch"" included cutting-edge technology, such as a cow milking machine, a telescope brought down from Edinburgh University, and the local newspaper using a newly-designed electric sign to flash out the latest news items.
Industry and consumer items were represented, some of them household names that remain, such as Hoover vacuum cleaners, Singer sewing machines, and Pyrex glass ovenware.
Andrews Liver Salts showed off its brand with a 15ft ""fountain of health"".
For entertainment there was an amusement park, a Himalayan Railway, and an African village.
More than four million people passed through the turnstiles between May and October that year, including King Alfonso of Spain and the Sultan of Zanzibar. Each millionth visitor was presented with a gold watch.
When the exhibition ended, the pavilions were dismantled and the area reverted to a public park.
Unfortunately, that ""northern punch"" would fall victim to the economic depression a few years later, in the 1930s.","One of the reasons the Great Exhibition of the North was awarded to Newcastle and Gateshead was because of the ""ambition"" of  organisers.",37619510,"summary: One of the reasons the Great Exhibition of the North was awarded to Newcastle and Gateshead was because of the ""ambition"" of  organisers.","A)

"Walmart will give JD.com ownership of Yihaodian's marketplace, including the brand, website and app.
In exchange Walmart will take a near 5% stake in JD.com, China's second largest e-commerce firm after Alibaba.
Walmart took full control of Yihaodian last year, but has struggled to grow its market share.
""We're excited about teaming up with such a strong leader in JD.com, and the potential that this new relationship creates for customers in China, as well as for our businesses,"" said Walmart chief executive Doug McMillon.
Walmart will be listed as a preferred seller on JD.com, offering it greater exposure to the Chinese market.
Walmart's Sam's Club brand will launch a shop on JD.com's website.
The deal will also help grow Yihaodian in the western and northern regions of the country where it is less well-known.
""We look forward to further developing Yihaodian, which has tremendous strength in important regions of eastern and southern China,"" said JD.com chief executive Richard Liu.

"A message on Luton councillor Aysegul Gurbuz's Twitter feed claimed Hitler was the ""greatest man in history"".
Another tweet on Ms Gurbaz's account suggested Iran could develop a nuclear weapon to ""wipe Israel off the map"".
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said anyone who makes anti-Semitic remarks is ""auto-excluded from the party"" pending an inquiry.

"The vote in the St Louis suburb is the first since the death of Michael Brown last August led to protests.
A federal investigation found racial bias in the Ferguson police department was widespread.
Two-thirds of Ferguson's residents are black and now half the council.
Shortly after the results came out, a video emerged showing an unarmed black man being shot dead by a police officer in South Carolina.
State investigators said the officer, Michael Slager, would be charged with murder after the video showed him firing at Walter Lamer Scott who was running away.
Turnout in Ferguson increased from 12% at the last elections, in 2013, to 29%.
Wesley Bell, who defeated another black candidate in Ferguson's third ward, said: ""This community came out in record numbers to make sure our voices were heard.
""When you have a community engaged, the sky is the limit.""
A drive by activists to register new voters and encourage previously disenfranchised residents to vote appeared to have paid off.
""People in general want to see change,"" Ferguson Mayor James Knowles told the Reuters news agency.
Ella Jones defeated another black candidate and two white candidates in Ferguson's first ward to become the first black woman on the council.
Black residents in Ferguson protested for several days last August after Mr Brown was shot dead by St Louis police officer Darren Wilson.
The protests spread nationwide in November when it was announced that Mr Wilson, who has since left the police, would not be charged.
US police have faced severe criticism from rights groups in the wake of Mr Brown's death, with a series of high-profile deaths of unarmed black men in police custody.","Voters in Ferguson, Missouri, where last year an unarmed black teenager was shot dead by police, have tripled the number of African-Americans on the six-member council from one to three.",32214200,"summary: Voters in Ferguson, Missouri, where last year an unarmed black teenager was shot dead by police, have tripled the number of African-Americans on the six-member council from one to three.","A)

"But the message may take some time to reach India.
The country had a lone shining moment with Girisha Hosanagara Nagarajegowda's silver medal in Men's High Jump F42 class for athletes with an impairment that affects their arms or legs.
And deservedly the nation cherished Girisha's feat as medals have generally eluded India's Paralympians. But now questions are being raised at the country's ability to translate the congratulatory tone into awareness of disabled rights.
India is not known for being friendly towards the disabled and most public places still lack basic facilities to help them in everyday life.ã€€
'Second-class' citizens
Even before Girisha won his medal, Indian media was abuzz with stories about problems at the Athletes' Village.
Several athletes complained that the Paralympics Committee of India had failed to book accommodation for escorts and coaches at the facility. This made the lives of the athletes very tough as they were denied precious time with their coaches.
Taking to CNN-IBN, weightlifter Farman Basha said his preparation was severely affected because he could not move freely in the village without his escort. ""I was confident of a medal and now all my training has gone in vain,"" he said.
The channel's editor, Rajdeep Sardesai, ran a special show to discuss whether India treats its Paralympians as second-class citizens. Many other channels and newspapers followed suit.
It's an irony that the controversy received more coverage than the Games themselves.
India may have won just one medal, but the Games were full of inspiring stories. The media seems to have clearly missed a chance to tell these stories to Indians in detail.ã€€
Speaking on the CNN-IBN show, Olympic silver medallist Rajyawardhan Singh Rathod said he was not surprised with the treatment of India's Paralympians.
He said much needs to be changed to give equal rights to Paralympians and millions of disabled people in India.
""It's an over-all attitude shift that we need to bring about in our country,"" he said.
There is another thread to the story that the India media seems to have missed. The Indian contingent at the Paralympics did not have a single female athlete.
While officials say this boils down to qualification woes, the problem runs much deeper.
Most schools and colleges lack basic sporting facilities for the disabled and the ones which do rarely encourage disabled women to participate.ã€€
While stories about the controversy continue to make headlines, nobody can take anything away from Girisha. The athlete certainly fought against the odds to make sure India did not return home from London empty handed.
He hails from the south Indian state of Karnataka and belongs to an average middle class family. But his determination to win a medal set him apart from others.
His training in Bangalore took place away from the glare of the media and fan recognition. With support from an NGO and government, Girisha quit his bank job six months ago to concentrate on training.
Today the result is there for everyone to see. And he hopes that his achievement will transcend the boundaries of sporting achievement and change the attitude of people towards disabled in India.

"It is a tiny signal seen in the way the waters at the ends of the 35km-long lake rise and fall.
When combined with the direct tug from the gravity of the Moon and Sun, the loch surface goes up and down by just 1.5mm.
The study is reported in the Journal of Geophysical Research.
""If you were on a boat in the middle of the loch, you certainly wouldn't notice it,"" said Philip Woodworth from the UK National Oceanography Centre (NOC), Liverpool, ""but a tide like this has never been observed in a western European lake before.""
Prof Woodworth, David Pugh and Machiel Bos say their precision measurement technique could be used in other lakes around the world to understand better how the Earth's crust deforms as a result of ocean movements - rather like a carpenter will use a spirit level to gauge how a length of wood deviates from the horizontal.
""I have described Loch Ness as the largest spirit level in the world,"" David Pugh, who is a visiting professor at NOC, told BBC News.
None of us can feel it, but Britain rises and falls by centimetres every 12 hours and 25 minutes as a great bulge of ocean water washes around the country.
The pencil-shaped Loch Ness is the largest UK lake by volume, and although inland, is close enough to the North Sea to be influenced by this loading effect.
The team placed pressure sensors a few metres under the lake surface at six locations, from Fort Augustus in the far southwest to Aldourie in the far northeast. They then monitored the change in the height of the overlying water during the course of 201 days.
What the scientists saw was a clear spike in the data twice a day - the result of the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun. But they could also tease out a second signal stemming from the way water rises and falls as a result of the tilting of the land. And, in fact, the latter effect sits on top of the first and is responsible for most of the amplitude change.
The team says the measurement was made to an accuracy of just 0.1 mm over the loch's 35 km length.
""We had to extract the tidal signal and get rid of all the noise. This involved very high precision,"" explained David Pugh.
""For example, the loch surface itself goes up and down every day by four centimetres just due to the pump storage scheme for hydroelectric generation, and we have to pull out a very small signal within that.
""The holy grail would be to learn from the effects of the tides something about the Earth's crust.  So the more precise we can get, the more we may learn about the crust.""

"Anatoly Kucherena told reporters his client would remain in the transit zone at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, where he has been for the past month.
Earlier, airport officials said that Mr Kucherena had given Mr Snowden the travel documents.
The US wants him extradited for leaking details of surveillance programmes.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has refused to hand him to the American authorities, but said he could stay in Russia only if he stopped leaking US secrets.
Mr Snowden, whose passport has been cancelled by the US, has stayed in the airport's transit area since arriving from Hong Kong on 23 June.
Who is Edward Snowden?
Where will Snowden end up?
Q&A: Prism
He has requested temporary asylum in Russia, and said recently his favoured final destination was Latin America.
Mr Kucherena visited his client at the airport on Wednesday and told a news conference later that the 30-year-old would not yet be leaving the airport.
He said the application for temporary asylum had not been processed, and no travel documents had been received.
""He is not planning to leave for now. He asked for temporary asylum, which in the case of a positive decision is granted for a term of one year,"" said Mr Kucherena.
The lawyer said Mr Snowden wanted to study Russian culture, adding that he had given the American books including Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment.
Mr Kucherena said Mr Snowden was ""anxious"" about leaving the airport.
""I hope that this situation will be resolved in the nearest future,"" he said. ""This is the first time Russia is facing such a situation, and this issue of course requires time for the immigration workers.""
The lawyer's account contradicted that of airport officials, who earlier told local media that the lawyer had handed Mr Snowden the documents he needed to leave the airport.
It was unclear whether there had been last-minute political intervention or some other problem.
The Interfax news agency quoted unnamed officials saying the American would be provided with new clothes before leaving the airport.
After the lawyer's news conference, the White House said it wanted clarity from Russia on his status.
Spokesman Jay Carney said Washington had already made it clear to Moscow that Mr Snowden should be handed over to face espionage charges.
The Snowden affair has caused diplomatic ructions around the world, upsetting America's close allies and traditional enemies.
