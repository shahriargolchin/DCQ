The series kicked off in the early 1950s, and gave birth to a minimum of eight motion pictures (none of which ever saw the light of day in the U.S.). 'O.S.S.117:Cairo,Nest Of Spies' is a light-hearted rom-com that should absolutely NOT be viewed with a serious lens. Our leading character ends up in the thick of an espionage pursuit in Egypt (with Morocco acting as Egypt's double) to uncover information about a long gone companion. What ensues is the typical James Bond/Inspector Cloussou type of hijinks. Although our agent is somewhat of a blatant xenophobe, sexist, homophobe, it's handled as sheer farce (as I mentioned, don't overanalyze it). While there is a touch of harsh language & cartoon violence, it's fundamentally suitable for older children (ages 12 & upwards).

Alas, I erred. Initially, the peculiar rerun? It was akin to viewing ""America's Funniest Home Videos"". The accursed folks. I abhorred them to a great extent. The stereotyped family of Latin origin? I need to converse with the person in charge. We need a conversation. The small girl perpetually attached to someone? I totally despised her and needed to express it. Now, the conclusive segment ascends, I have to concede. It's so marvelously poor and replete with inferiority that it characterizes a film of its own. Such appalling choreography. Atrocious and splendid at the same moment.

For starters, the odd recurrence? It felt similar to seeing ""America's Funniest Home Videos"". The blasted guardians. I despised them thoroughly. The conventional South American family? I have a need to dialogue with the person liable. A meeting is required. The diminutive girl constantly sticking to someone? I entirely detested her and needed to highlight it. Now, the ultimate sequence surpasses, I have to acknowledge. It's so beautifully awful and brimming with bad quality that it equates to a film of its own. What poor footwork. Awful and spectacular concurrently.

First, the weird looping? It was like watching ""America's Funniest Home Videos"". The damn parents. I hated them so much. The stereo-typical Latino family? I need to speak with the person responsible for this. We need to have a talk. That little girl who was always hanging on someone? I just hated her and had to mention it. Now, the final scene transcends, I must say. It's so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own. What crappy dancing. Horrible and beautiful at once.

This was a great movie. Something not only for Black History month but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the statement that it truly does take a village to raise a child. The performances by S Eptath was outstanding. Mos Def and his singing was off the hook. Had to do a double take when I saw that was Rosie Perez there. But the supporting cast of actors and actresses made this worth watching. All the different stories they had was amazing. And how Nanny protected Jr and literally everyone else that was in her presence. I can truly understand her being the matriarch of that time period and even more so how tired she was in helping everyone. Cant wait for it to come out on DVD.

This is, akin to ""Bloodsurf"", the poorest ""scary movie"" I have ever viewed. Lousy players, lousy technical delivery, lousy plot, etcetera. The score, nevertheless, isn't too horrid. That's the reason I assign it a 2 on the tally and not merely a 1. Naturally, the cats were an optimistic revelation. They are easily the most accomplished performers in this movie... Do not borrow or own it. Dodge it and envision that this hideous, hideous film recedes into some vague realm and does not convert into a ""cult classic"". Absolutely, it doesn't merit any recognition.

This is, next to ""Bloodsurf"", the worst ""horrormovie"" I have ever seen. Crappy actors, crappy technical output, crappy story and so on. The soundtrack though, isn't to bad. That is why I give it a 2 on the vote and not just a 1. And of course the cats are a positive surprise. By far the superior actors in this movie..... Do not rent or buy it.

text: I'm a teenager of 15 years, typically other teens don't treat themselves to such old renowned films. However, this is on my list of admired ones. I became completely obsessed after the initial viewing. It's definitely commendable considering the tech and cinema of that period, superior music, satisfactory plot, fantastic dance moves, a must watch. Why a preface to this film beats me. Only a few truly appreciate this film, but for me, old romantic films take the lead, they vastly surpass today's cinema! This piece will prompt you to grin, shed tears and feel the urge to move to the rhythm. The tunes are truly captivating and wonderful. Dirty Dancing 2 Havana Nights - the foreword is yet to be screened by me; ideally, it should showcase the first cast, that's my gripe with introductions, they spoil the original. Everyone desires a follow-up, not an introduction. A consensus exists that trilogies are best - the original, followed by parts two and three. Anything beyond this, tends to be overlooked. Who still recalls the tale about the St Benard Beethoven? If my memory serves right, it comprised five episodes.

text: At 15, not often do adolescents indulge in retro significant films. Nevertheless, this counts among my top picks. My fascination was instantly sparked post the debut screening. Contemplating the state of tech and filmmaking then, it is to be recognized, excellent music, okayish narrative, superb dance sequences, demands to be seen. I fail to understand the rationale behind an antecedent for this movie. The fanclub for this might be small, but my penchant leans towards classic romance cinema, they just outrank present-day works! This production guarantees laughs, tears, and a spontaneous dance groove. The music is genuinely alluring and fantastic. Dirty Dancing 2 Harvana Nights (preface), hasn't graced my viewing yet; ideally, it should retain the initial artists, very characteristic of my dislike towards antecedents, they distort the original. The general public clamours for sequels, not antecedents. Most agree that a cinematic trilogy suffices- the first, sequel and the third edition. Further extensions tend not to lure the audience. Is the saga of St Benard Beethoven still fresh in anyone's memory? If I recall right, it incorporated five entries in total.

This feature will induce laughter, tears and trigger an urge to sway to the rhythm. The soundtrack is truly grabbing and exquisite.

Does anyone recollect the motion picture about the St Benard Beethoven? As far as I recall, it ran for five installments.

text: I'm 15, usually not kids my age usually watch these old classic movies. But this is one of my favorites. I was totally addicted after watching it for the first time. It's really good if u think about technology and movies back at that time, music is great, storyline is OK,choreography is great, must see it. I don't know why there's a prequel for this movie. Not many people like this movie, but i love classic love movies, they're so much better than movies now! This movie will make you smile, cry and make you start dancing. The music is absolutely ear catching and beautiful. I haven't seen Dirty Dancing 2 Harvana Nights(prequel), prequel should have star the original actors, thats what i hate about prequels, they ruin the original. No one wants a prequel, they want a sequel. Many people will agree that for a movie- the original, sequel and the 3rd one is enough. Beyond that, people wont be bothered to watch it. Who remembers the movie about the St Benard Beethoven? I think there's 5 movies altogether.
label: 1 (positive)","text: I'm a teenager of 15 years, typically other teens don't treat themselves to such old renowned films. However, this is on my list of admired ones. I became completely obsessed after the initial viewing. It's definitely commendable considering the tech and cinema of that period, superior music, satisfactory plot, fantastic dance moves, a must watch. Why a preface to this film beats me. Only a few truly appreciate this film, but for me, old romantic films take the lead, they vastly surpass today's cinema! This piece will prompt you to grin, shed tears and feel the urge to move to the rhythm. The tunes are truly captivating and wonderful. Dirty Dancing 2 Havana Nights - the foreword is yet to be screened by me; ideally, it should showcase the first cast, that's my gripe with introductions, they spoil the original. Everyone desires a follow-up, not an introduction. A consensus exists that trilogies are best - the original, followed by parts two and three. Anything beyond this, tends to be overlooked. Who still recalls the tale about the St Benard Beethoven? If my memory serves right, it comprised five episodes.
label: 1 (positive)","text: At 15, not often do adolescents indulge in retro significant films. Nevertheless, this counts among my top picks. My fascination was instantly sparked post the debut screening. Contemplating the state of tech and filmmaking then, it is to be recognized, excellent music, okayish narrative, superb dance sequences, demands to be seen. I fail to understand the rationale behind an antecedent for this movie. The fanclub for this might be small, but my penchant leans towards classic romance cinema, they just outrank present-day works! This production guarantees laughs, tears, and a spontaneous dance groove. The music is genuinely alluring and fantastic. Dirty Dancing 2 Harvana Nights (preface), hasn't graced my viewing yet; ideally, it should retain the initial artists, very characteristic of my dislike towards antecedents, they distort the original. The general public clamours for sequels, not antecedents. Most agree that a cinematic trilogy suffices- the first, sequel and the third edition. Further extensions tend not to lure the audience. Is the saga of St Benard Beethoven still fresh in anyone's memory? If I recall right, it incorporated five entries in total.

Insert a pair of males (a spouse and a different man), position an absolute stunner of a female between them, append a desolate isle, deduct all her ethical dilemmas, append several ethical complications to the males and blend it all in a copious vessel of disputes, seafood, and a zippo lighter you get a worthless motion picture akin to this. The performing is decent, to my mind. There are a few errors but hardly noticeable. The leading lady nauseates me. This stems from her deficit in ethical principles. She's drawn to the guy with the most seafood. Even though one of them is her life partner, she perceives no issue being disloyal to (Manuel) the other guy because ""I have to do it for survival"". How can you validate sleeping with another man for seafood while your spouse is within 30feet? Despite him not gaining from it? The woman appears to effortlessly justify everything she does. If she fails to get endorsement for her deeds, she plays the victim. I encourage everyone to watch this film.

text: Undoubtedly a film for individuals who want nothing but to be amused and avoid dwelling on their cinema. Plenty of excitement, plenteous interesting conversations (e.g., enjoyable to repeat), a tad mystery, and things exploding everywhere. Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis demonstrated excellent rapport. Brutal, but not grisly. The actuality that the feminine role was the adept action protagonist is a refreshing change. I've witnessed this film over twelve times, still derive pleasure from it and revisit it amid my favored movie series every quarter yet. Initially, I borrowed the film because Samuel L Jackson starred in it but became engrossed in the circumstances of Samantha's journey to recover her recollection and have never retrospect. For all you intellectual types - let your skepticism go for a while, take yourself lightly - you may find leisure!

Loads of thrilling moments, a wealth of compelling dialogues (e.g., entertaining to echo), minor suspense, and rampant explosions. Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis exhibited exceptional synergism. Hostile, yet not graphic. The revelation that the woman role assumed the skilled action lead is a delightful switch around. I have watched the motion picture beyond a dozen times and still find it engaging enough to bring it into my cherished movie cycle every tri or quad months. Initially, I leased the film because Samuel L Jackson was featured but got drawn into Samantha's endeavor to retrieve her memory and have never turned around.

Ample action, numerous fascinating discussions (e.g., amusing to parrot), bits of enigma, and widespread detonation. Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis portrayed strong camaraderie.

I've screened the cinema above twelve times and still relish it enough to reintegrate it in my preferred films frequency every 90 to 120 days.

It was impossible to comprehend his emotional state and his movements felt mechanical. Furthermore, my feelings towards Vann are ambiguous.

Although he's introduced as the central figure, he begins a liaison with a Vietnamese English instructor soon after his arrival in Vietnam.

There are a great many ways in which a film can become hackneyed, and this one manages to utilize most of them, including an obligatory slow motion bedroom scene of passion. A low budget affair shot in Vancouver, even police procedural aspects are displayed by rote. The always capable Gershon tries to make something of her role, but Mancuso is incredibly histrionic, bizarrely so, as he attacks his lines with an obvious loose rein.

text: Designed for light amusement, this movie does act the part quite successfully in its initial sequences but then yields to a swiftly sinking script that pulls it under. Harry (Judd Nelson), a ""redeemed"" thief, and Daphne (Gina Gershon), a budding actress, work as live mannequins in a store where they end up overstaying one evening and get locked inside. From behind a scarcely protective glass, they witness what seems to be a murder in the street. The apparent killer, Miles Raymond (Nick Mancuso), a local artist, comes back the next day to study the mannequins, aware that they are the only prospective observers of the previous night's brutal incident. One of the duo ""twitches"" sparking off the true excitement. Harry and Daphne recount their experience at the nearest police station, where the questionable past of Harry makes the detective skeptical. This movie manages to employ many cliches conveniently, including a mandatory passionate slow-motion scene in the bedroom. A budget-constrained project filmed in Vancouver, even the police procedure is showcased in a mechanical way. Despite the movie descending into absurdity, Glen MacPherson, the director of photography, bucks this trend by creating striking compositions. Hal Beckett also provides a meticulously tailored soundtrack. Initially, the dialogue is rather fresh and delivered congenially in a repartee style by Nelson and Gershon, but as the logic and continuity begin to unravel, predictability prevails. The direction reflects the absence of innovative ideas and the shortcomings of post-production adversely impact the overall result.

text: Planned for light-hearted diversion, the movie indeed delivers on this front in the beginning, only to be let down by a swiftly failing script. Harry (Judd Nelson), a ""converted"" robber, paired up with Daphne (Gina Gershon), a hopeful actress, are hired as living window models at a store.  One day they leave late and get trapped inside, upon which they witness a likely murder through a transparent but inadequate barricade. The potential murderer, Miles Raymond (Nick Mancuso), a local craftsman, comes back to observe the mannequins the next day, recognizing them as the only probable spectators to the earlier night's violent episode. The excitement starts when one of the pair ""flutters"". The duo talk to cops about what they saw, but the officer's familiarity with Harry’s felony past leads to doubt. The film manages to incorporate most cliches and trite elements, including a prerequisite bedroom passion scene in slow motion. The budget constraints are obvious, being shot in Vancouver and even the enforcement aspects are presented as repetitive actions. This film descends into incongruity, but cinematographer Glen MacPherson, opts to not mirror the decline through his beautifully constructed shots using camera and lighting. Hal Beckett provides an apt score, dictated by the unfolding events. The dialogue starts off fresh and is exchanged between Nelson and Gershon in a playful way, but as continuity and logic issues crop up, the predictable nature of the movie takes over. Lack of creativity and post-production errors weaken the overall impact.

text: Projected as uncomplicated leisure, this film scores initially, only to be later hijacked by a rapidly deteriorating script. The film features Harry (Judd Nelson), a ""rehabilitated"" burglar, and Daphne (Gina Gershon) an ambitious actress, who get jobs as live display figures at a retail store. One night, being delayed in exiting, they get locked inside and end up witnessing a possible murder from behind a not-so-safe glass enclosure.  The supposed killer, Miles Raymond (Nick Mancuso), a local designer, returns the next day to scrutinize the mannequins under the assumption that they are the only possible sources who have seen the previous night's violent incident. Excitement ensues when one of the duo ""quivers"". When they lodge a police complaint, the officer, recalling Harry's criminal records, becomes dismissive. The movie exhausts numerous potboilers, mandatory passionate slow-motion bedroom scene included. Despite its budget restrictions, manifest in being shot in Vancouver and uninspiring police procedural scenes, not everything is pedestrian. Glen MacPherson, the cameraman, breaks free from this, with his meticulously shot frames considering lighting and camera angles. Hal Beckett leaves a mark with his perfectly synchronized score. The narrative swings between witty and clichéd dialogue, sparking cheerful banter between Nelson and Gershon initially, only for it to fall flat owing to flawed continuity and predictability. The directorial vision is replete with too much of the same, with post-production errors compounding the disappointment.

The mentioned dialogue is initially somewhat fresh and delivered well in a bantering manner by Nelson and Gershon, but in a subsequent context of flawed continuity and logic, predictability takes over. The direction reflects a lack of original ideas or point of view, and post-production flaws set the work back farther than should be expected for a basic thriller.
label: 0 (negative)","text: Designed for light amusement, this movie does act the part quite successfully in its initial sequences but then yields to a swiftly sinking script that pulls it under. Harry (Judd Nelson), a ""redeemed"" thief, and Daphne (Gina Gershon), a budding actress, work as live mannequins in a store where they end up overstaying one evening and get locked inside. From behind a scarcely protective glass, they witness what seems to be a murder in the street. The apparent killer, Miles Raymond (Nick Mancuso), a local artist, comes back the next day to study the mannequins, aware that they are the only prospective observers of the previous night's brutal incident. One of the duo ""twitches"" sparking off the true excitement. Harry and Daphne recount their experience at the nearest police station, where the questionable past of Harry makes the detective skeptical. This movie manages to employ many cliches conveniently, including a mandatory passionate slow-motion scene in the bedroom. A budget-constrained project filmed in Vancouver, even the police procedure is showcased in a mechanical way. Despite the movie descending into absurdity, Glen MacPherson, the director of photography, bucks this trend by creating striking compositions. Hal Beckett also provides a meticulously tailored soundtrack. Initially, the dialogue is rather fresh and delivered congenially in a repartee style by Nelson and Gershon, but as the logic and continuity begin to unravel, predictability prevails. The direction reflects the absence of innovative ideas and the shortcomings of post-production adversely impact the overall result.
label: 0 (negative)","text: Planned for light-hearted diversion, the movie indeed delivers on this front in the beginning, only to be let down by a swiftly failing script. Harry (Judd Nelson), a ""converted"" robber, paired up with Daphne (Gina Gershon), a hopeful actress, are hired as living window models at a store.  One day they leave late and get trapped inside, upon which they witness a likely murder through a transparent but inadequate barricade. The potential murderer, Miles Raymond (Nick Mancuso), a local craftsman, comes back to observe the mannequins the next day, recognizing them as the only probable spectators to the earlier night's violent episode. The excitement starts when one of the pair ""flutters"". The duo talk to cops about what they saw, but the officer's familiarity with Harry’s felony past leads to doubt. The film manages to incorporate most cliches and trite elements, including a prerequisite bedroom passion scene in slow motion. The budget constraints are obvious, being shot in Vancouver and even the enforcement aspects are presented as repetitive actions. This film descends into incongruity, but cinematographer Glen MacPherson, opts to not mirror the decline through his beautifully constructed shots using camera and lighting. Hal Beckett provides an apt score, dictated by the unfolding events. The dialogue starts off fresh and is exchanged between Nelson and Gershon in a playful way, but as continuity and logic issues crop up, the predictable nature of the movie takes over. Lack of creativity and post-production errors weaken the overall impact.
label: 0 (negative)","text: Projected as uncomplicated leisure, this film scores initially, only to be later hijacked by a rapidly deteriorating script. The film features Harry (Judd Nelson), a ""rehabilitated"" burglar, and Daphne (Gina Gershon) an ambitious actress, who get jobs as live display figures at a retail store. One night, being delayed in exiting, they get locked inside and end up witnessing a possible murder from behind a not-so-safe glass enclosure.  The supposed killer, Miles Raymond (Nick Mancuso), a local designer, returns the next day to scrutinize the mannequins under the assumption that they are the only possible sources who have seen the previous night's violent incident. Excitement ensues when one of the duo ""quivers"". When they lodge a police complaint, the officer, recalling Harry's criminal records, becomes dismissive. The movie exhausts numerous potboilers, mandatory passionate slow-motion bedroom scene included. Despite its budget restrictions, manifest in being shot in Vancouver and uninspiring police procedural scenes, not everything is pedestrian. Glen MacPherson, the cameraman, breaks free from this, with his meticulously shot frames considering lighting and camera angles. Hal Beckett leaves a mark with his perfectly synchronized score. The narrative swings between witty and clichéd dialogue, sparking cheerful banter between Nelson and Gershon initially, only for it to fall flat owing to flawed continuity and predictability. The directorial vision is replete with too much of the same, with post-production errors compounding the disappointment.
label: 0 (negative)","text: Intended as light entertainment, this film is indeed successful as such during its first half, but then succumbs to a rapidly foundering script that drops it down. Harry (Judd Nelson), a ""reformed"" burglar, and Daphne (Gina Gershon), an aspiring actress, are employed as live window mannequins at a department store where one evening they are late in leaving and are locked within, whereupon they witness, from their less than protective glass observation point, an apparent homicide occurring on the street. The ostensible murderer, Miles Raymond (Nick Mancuso), a local sculptor, returns the following day to observe the mannequins since he realizes that they are the only possible witnesses to the prior night's violent event and, when one of the posing pair ""flinches"", the fun begins. Daphne and Harry report their observations at a local police station, but when the detective taking a crime report remembers Harry's criminal background, he becomes cynical. There are a great many ways in which a film can become hackneyed, and this one manages to utilize most of them, including an obligatory slow motion bedroom scene of passion. A low budget affair shot in Vancouver, even police procedural aspects are displayed by rote. The always capable Gershon tries to make something of her role, but Mancuso is incredibly histrionic, bizarrely so, as he attacks his lines with an obvious loose rein.

With a bigger budget, better opening, and a re-write for crisper characterizations, this could have been something approaching classic 1950s science fiction.<br /><br />*** Night of the Blood Beast (1958) Bernard L.

One issue that I simply could not overlook was the fact that Joanne possesses BROWN eyes. Scarlett's attractive beauty was largely accentuated by her green eyes, and in this subsequent part, that trait has been removed.<br /><br />Both the film and the literature experienced multiple instances of stagnation. The newly-introduced characters didn't leave much of a lasting impression and I often confused them. It seemed to me as if her journey to Ireland had absolutely no significant impact. Possibly, it's because I'm at the tender age of 11, but I didn't perceive a transformation in her character until during the final, say, 10 minutes when Rhett pointed out her maturity. Had Rhett not made that observation, I would have remained unaware of any shift in her behavior. She truly adored Cat, her offspring. She preferred this infant the most as it was fathered by Rhett, her sole beloved spouse. However, if you are familiar with Gone With The Wind, you would realize that offspring holds no substantial value in Scarlett's life.<br /><br />Candidly speaking, I felt the narrative was excessively congested without Rhett's presence. The ultimate concern everyone harbors is about the possibility of Rhett and Scarlett reconciling, and Scarlett procrastinated unnecessarily long for that. In comparison to Gone With The Wind, it is practically insignificant, but then again, what isn't? If you have perused the book, you will appreciate that more than the film.<br /><br />I would still consider viewing it, solely because it is the sequel to Gone With The Wind, regardless of its questionable worth. Although it may not leave you completely satisfied, it would satiate some of your curiosity.

The emerald eyes undoubtedly accentuated Scarlett's charm, and unfortunately, this component is absent in this sequel.<br /><br />The film, synonymous to the novel, had several dull moments.

Without this revelation by Rhett, I would have been oblivious to any such change. She deeply cared for Cat, her infant. She favors this offspring more since it is a love-child with Rhett, her exclusive beloved partner. Yet, as highlighted in Gone With The Wind, progenies had no significant role in Scarlett's universe.<br /><br />Personally, I thought there was way too much happening without Rhett's involvement. The sheer concern lies in whether Rhett and Scarlett reconcile or not, and Scarlett tarried excessively long for that. It barely holds a candle to Gone With The Wind, but really, what does? If you've gone through the actual text, you will find that more enjoyable than the film.<br /><br />Despite everything, I'd give it a viewing just because it's the continuation of Gone With The Wind, notwithstanding whether it's worthy or not.

The intricacy of this situation wasn't sufficiently surfaced. Too much duration is spent on the pursuit involving the truckers who are moving the baby.

Adequate depth of this situation was not portrayed. An excessive volume of time is consumed on the trailing with truckers ferrying the baby. (Curiously, this baby who has difficulty breathing--you never observe him weep-- except a single time--, be fed, or get his diaper flipped during the complete trucking hardship.)

text: An incredibly fragile theme-- a 15-year-old female forsaken by her mother as an infant who travels to see her, still endures neglect, is sexually violated by her mom's companion, and becomes expectant. This situation wasn't examined in enough detail. A surplus of time is occupied by the pursuit alongside truckers shuttling the baby. (Fascinatingly, this baby with lung problems--you never watch him shed a tear-- except for one time--, be nourished, or get his diaper swapped during the entire transportation predicament.) I would have desired more of relation dynamics, further spotlight on the fact that this girl was underage--this ought to have been instantaneously prominent in the court.<br /><br />And this was factually based! It was worthy of a higher quality narration than what was provided!!<br /><br />If the subject wasn't as it was, I would have tended towards giving this closer to a 0 for its rating. I fetched this copy from a community library. Only afterwards, I discovered it was a small screen cinema.<br /><br />so be it

label: 0 (negative)","text: Well, where to start describing this celluloid debacle? You already know the big fat NADA passing as a plot, so let's jut point out that this is so PC it's offensive. Hard to believe that Frank Oz, the same guy that gave us laugh riots like Little Shop of Horrors and Bowfinger, made this unfunny mess.<br /><br />So, this guy doesn't know he's gay till this actor points it out. OK, sure. If anyone ever says I'm gay, I'll know the truth, even if I currently like girls more than George Luca$ likes a dollar.<br /><br />And how to know the true nature of my sexuality? Well, if I like classic litterature, dancing and Barbra Streisand, I'm gay. If I dress like a blind man in a hurry (with half my shirt hanging out), I'm straight. Oh, sure.<br /><br />And here's the big cliché of clichés: no matter how you look, there's always a very attractive Hollywood actor who'll adore every bit of grease under your skin, or a top model who'll love your zero IQ, your butt-ugly face and your pointing-out ears. If all those gay common places weren't enough to get me angry, this did. In real world looks matter, folks, and I know for sure.<br /><br />I see it coming: now you'll say ""Relax! It's a comedy! Don't take it so seriously!"". If being a comedy gives anything ""carte blanche"" to suck out loud, I think the world has a serious problem. Wouldn't be much better (and funnier) to make a movie to denegate those old tiresome clichés, instead of magnifying them over and over again?<br /><br />So, one of the absolutely worst movies I've ever seen. 1 out of 10. If giving this rating has something to do with my sexual tendence, please let me know. I'm interested.

text: Evening on BBC1, I was heading to sleep yet my curiosity was aroused by a modern-set Irish movie so I stuck around to view for a little while and then remained until the conclusion. I have to confess that the primary allure was the sole English actress, Kelly Reilly, who is captivating to gaze upon.<br /><br /> This is advertised as a dark humor, which is one of the trickiest things to execute. It should be the ideal fusion of terror and horrific laughs so that in the conclusion you don't comprehend why you're chuckling - for me Martin Scorsese's After Hours (1985) is the top instance. Dead Bodies is more dark than humorous but the storyline rushes and spirals down towards additional darkness. I didn't notice the ultimate twists in the story as some other commentators here did so I was appropriately amazed. <br /><br /> As a glimpse of the Irish movie industry in 2003, it all appears fairly commendable; it doesn't appear like they invested too much in its production so it had a possibility to make its investment back. The screenplay could've been a whole lot more clear-cut but the performance was for the most part fairly decent. I'm pleased I saw it, deficiencies and all, even though I don't believe I garnered much about Ireland presently, especially their law enforcement techniques!

I must acknowledge that the key interest was the sole English actress, Kelly Reilly, who is mesmerizing to behold.<br /><br /> This is marketed as a bleak humor, which is among the hardest things to accomplish. It ought to be the impeccable blend of dread and dreadful laughs such that in the finale you don't understand why you're laughing - to me Martin Scorsese's After Hours (1985) stands out as the finest example. Dead Bodies is more somber than hilarious but the narrative proceeds speedily and spirals down towards more darkness. I didn't see the terminal twists in the saga as some other contributors here did so I was aptly stunned. <br /><br /> As a brief look at the Irish cinematic sector in 2003, it overall appears quite valuable; it doesn't seem like they poured too much in its creation so there was a chance for it to recover its cost. The script could've been significantly crisper but the acting was for the most part reasonably good. I'm delighted I viewed it, defects and all, albeit I don't think I gathered much about Ireland in the present day, particularly their patrolling tactics!

I must concede that the main appeal was the single English actress, Kelly Reilly, who is dazzling to behold.<br /><br />This is labeled as a black comedy, which is one of the most daunting things to achieve. It ought to be the prime blend of fright and horrifying giggles such that at the end you're left wondering why you're giggling - to me Martin Scorsese's After Hours (1985) is the leading one. Dead Bodies is darker than it is comedic but the plot races and spirals down into increased blackness. I didn't perceive the conclusive turns in the plot as some other folks here did so I was fittingly astounded.<br /><br />As a quick look at the Irish film scene in 2003, it all seems reasonably praiseworthy; it doesn't seem like they spent a lot in its creation thus it had the potential to earn its expense back. The plot could've been dramatically sharper but the acting was generally quite good. I'm satisfied I watched it, faults and all, however I don't presume I learnt much about Ireland currently, especially their policing strategies!

label: 1 (positive)","text: Evening on BBC1, I was heading to sleep yet my curiosity was aroused by a modern-set Irish movie so I stuck around to view for a little while and then remained until the conclusion. I have to confess that the primary allure was the sole English actress, Kelly Reilly, who is captivating to gaze upon.<br /><br /> This is advertised as a dark humor, which is one of the trickiest things to execute. It should be the ideal fusion of terror and horrific laughs so that in the conclusion you don't comprehend why you're chuckling - for me Martin Scorsese's After Hours (1985) is the top instance. Dead Bodies is more dark than humorous but the storyline rushes and spirals down towards additional darkness. I didn't notice the ultimate twists in the story as some other commentators here did so I was appropriately amazed. <br /><br /> As a glimpse of the Irish movie industry in 2003, it all appears fairly commendable; it doesn't appear like they invested too much in its production so it had a possibility to make its investment back. The screenplay could've been a whole lot more clear-cut but the performance was for the most part fairly decent. I'm pleased I saw it, deficiencies and all, even though I don't believe I garnered much about Ireland presently, especially their law enforcement techniques!
label: 1 (positive)","text: Late-night on BBC1, was en route to slumber but interest was aroused at a current-set Irish cinema so I lingered to watch for a moment and then remained till the finish. I must acknowledge that the key interest was the sole English actress, Kelly Reilly, who is mesmerizing to behold.<br /><br /> This is marketed as a bleak humor, which is among the hardest things to accomplish. It ought to be the impeccable blend of dread and dreadful laughs such that in the finale you don't understand why you're laughing - to me Martin Scorsese's After Hours (1985) stands out as the finest example. Dead Bodies is more somber than hilarious but the narrative proceeds speedily and spirals down towards more darkness. I didn't see the terminal twists in the saga as some other contributors here did so I was aptly stunned. <br /><br /> As a brief look at the Irish cinematic sector in 2003, it overall appears quite valuable; it doesn't seem like they poured too much in its creation so there was a chance for it to recover its cost. The script could've been significantly crisper but the acting was for the most part reasonably good. I'm delighted I viewed it, defects and all, albeit I don't think I gathered much about Ireland in the present day, particularly their patrolling tactics!
label: 1 (positive)","text: Late in the night on BBC1, was journeying to bed yet interest was kindled by a present-day Irish motion picture so I held on to watch for a bit and then stayed till the culmination. I must concede that the main appeal was the single English actress, Kelly Reilly, who is dazzling to behold.<br /><br />This is labeled as a black comedy, which is one of the most daunting things to achieve. It ought to be the prime blend of fright and horrifying giggles such that at the end you're left wondering why you're giggling - to me Martin Scorsese's After Hours (1985) is the leading one. Dead Bodies is darker than it is comedic but the plot races and spirals down into increased blackness. I didn't perceive the conclusive turns in the plot as some other folks here did so I was fittingly astounded.<br /><br />As a quick look at the Irish film scene in 2003, it all seems reasonably praiseworthy; it doesn't seem like they spent a lot in its creation thus it had the potential to earn its expense back. The plot could've been dramatically sharper but the acting was generally quite good. I'm satisfied I watched it, faults and all, however I don't presume I learnt much about Ireland currently, especially their policing strategies!

It should be the perfect blend of horror and horrible laughs so that in the end you don't know why you're laughing - for me Martin Scorsese's After Hours (1985) is the best example. Dead Bodies is more black than comedy but the plot rattles along and spirals down towards further blackness. I didn't spot the final twists in the tale as some other posters here did so I was suitably surprised.<br /><br />As a snapshot of the Irish film industry in 2003, it all seems rather worthy; it doesn't look like they spent too much on the making of it so it had a chance to make its money back.

A not so good action thriller because it unsuccessfully trends the same water as early Steven Seagal films because there is not a very good set piece. Steven Seagal plays the same kind of character that he has played since Above the Law. In my opinion the performance of Keenen Ivory Wayans is wasted in such an average film and belongs in a much better film. Bob Gunton is okay as the main heavy. The best acting in the entire film belongs to Brian Cox who is very frightening in the role of the murderer. My favorite scenes are the fight scenes with the Russian mafia. One of the film reasons to see The Glimmer Man(1996) is for the brief appearence of the beautiful and voluptupus Nikki Cox.

Steven Seagal portrays a similar character to what he has previously since Above the Law. I personally believe the acting skills of Keenen Ivory Wayans are squandered in such a mediocre movie and deserve a considerably superior film. Bob Gunton is passable as the chief villain. The top-notch acting in the full film belongs to Brian Cox, who is incredibly terrifying as the assassin. My ideal sequences are combat scenes with the Russian gangsters. One of the compelling reasons to watch The Glimmer Man(1996) is the fleeting presence of the stunning and voluptuous Nikki Cox. It's a shame that she didn't appear in more scenes.

Steven Seagal takes on a similar role that he has had since Above the Law. According to my view, the talent of Keenen Ivory Wayans is squandered in such an ordinary film which deserved to be part of a much superior film. Bob Gunton is decent as the lead antagonist. The finest performance in the whole film is by Brian Cox who is extremely intimidating as the killer. My preferred episodes are the brawl sequences with the Russian mob. One motive to watch The Glimmer Man(1996) is for the brief showcase of the gorgeous and sultry Nikki Cox. It's a detriment that more scenes involving her were not included.

Steven Seagal embodies a similar character he has portrayed since Above the Law. From my perspective, the display of Keenen Ivory Wayans' ability is misdirected in such an unremarkable movie and should be in a much superior film. Bob Gunton is acceptable as the principal villain. The most distinguished acting in the full-length movie is credited to Brian Cox who is intensely scary as the murderer. My favorite parts include the combat episodes with the Russian underworld. A reason to see The Glimmer Man(1996) is for the transient appearance of the ravishing and provocative Nikki Cox. It’s unfortunate that she was underutilized in the movie.

"Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.<br /><br />At first he goes to boot camp, where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line. That's a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight!<br /><br />Next thing you know he's in France in a trench. Hilarious scenes here include a starving Charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder.<br /><br />When Charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring. This is such a funny part! I can't really describe it, just watch the movie. When Charlie wakes up his legs feel numb so he tries to 'wake them up'. It had me rolling on the floor when it turns out his second leg still feels numb... while Charlie actually rubs his roommate's foot!<br /><br />The movie then turns a bit grim, as Charlie shoots a couple of Germans from his trench (although it's done in a very funny way) and him personating as a tree to get close to the enemy, saving a friend of his from a death squad.<br /><br />Last part is him getting a french girl in trouble by hiding in her house. He then has to save her and while doing so he captures the german kaiser as well. To do so he impersonates a german kolonel or something. I love it when Charlie is asked something in german and he's like nein nein nein. The soldier looks at him in a funny way so Charlie changes his mind: ja ja ja! The kaiser gets captured and Charlie is the hero... but then he wakes up again in bootcamp, it was just a sweet dream!<br /><br />Charlie did one of those 'dream-sequences' before (The Bank comes to mind) but who cares, this movie was so funny it had me laughing all the way. Chaplin also has something to say with this movie (as his later work became more of a social comment to several mishaps in the world) and is explained best in the last sentence of the movie: 'Peace on earth, good will to all mankind.'<br /><br />In short: a Charlie classic, very funny, timeless. 9/10.",1 (positive),"text: Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.<br /><br />At first he goes to boot camp, where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line.

text: Superb Chaplin film with numerous unforgettable scenes as Charlie signs up for the military to battle in World War 1.<br /><br />Initially, he attends basic training, where he acquires the skills to manage his gun and to march in a row. This is an extremely humorous section because the vagabond isn't accustomed to aligning his feet!<br /><br />Soon enough, he's in France, stationed in a trench. Comical episodes here involve a famished Charlie consuming the cheese off a mousetrap, and perusing a letter from home over another's shoulder.<br /><br />Upon retiring to bed, Charlie discovers his dugout completely inundated, and his bunkmate loudly snoring. This part is just hilarious! It is hard to articulate – better to see it in the film. Upon arising, his legs are asleep so, he attempts to 'stir them awake.' A real burst of laughter ensued when it emerged that his other leg still feels numb... while Charlie is actually massaging his roomie's foot!<br /><br />Following this, the film becomes slightly bleak, as Charlie takes down some Germans from his trench (although displayed humorously) and him masquerading as a tree to infiltrate the enemy lines, rescuing his buddy from a firing squad.<br /><br />The final segment involves Charlie getting a French girl into a predicament by concealing himself in her residence. He is required to rescue her and in the process, he captures the German emperor, too. To accomplish this he poses as a German colonel or so. It's entertaining when Charlie is questioned in German and he's all like no no no. The soldier gives him a funny look, making Charlie switch his answer: yes yes yes! The Kaiser is apprehended, and Charlie emerges victorious... only to awaken back in basic training, realizing it was all just a beautiful dream!<br /><br />Charlie employed these 'fantasy-sequences' previously (The Bank comes to mind) but who gives a darn, this film was incredibly amusing that I couldn't stop laughing throughout. Chaplin also uses this film to deliver a message (as later works started conveying more societal commentary relating to various unfortunate incidents globally) evident in the movie's concluding dialogue: 'Peace on earth, good will to all mankind.'<br /><br />In summary: a Chaplin classic, extremely humorous, timeless. 9/10.

Extraordinary Chaplin picture packed with several indelible instances as Charlie enlists in the armed forces to participate in the Great War.<br /><br />To begin with, he is sent to army training, where he must become familiar with managing his firearm and marching in formation. This is quite a comical segment since the hobo isn’t used to keeping his feet even!<br /><br />Before long, he's stationed in France, in a trench. Side-splitting scenes here have a hungry Charlie nibbling the cheese off a mousetrap, and scanning a home letter over someone's shoulder.<br /><br />When it's bedtime, Charlie finds his war shelter submerged, with his cot partner snoring heavily. This section is simply comedy gold! It's tough to define – it's preferable to just see the film. Upon waking, Charlie’s legs are stiff, and he tries to 'revive them.' Uncontrollable laughter followed when it appears that the other leg still feels numb... while Charlie is actually stroking his fellow soldier's foot!<br /><br />Afterwards, the film shifts to a slightly somber tone, as Charlie eliminates some Germans from his trench (albeit humorously executed) and him disguising as a tree to approach the enemy, saving his pal from an execution squad.<br /><br />Lastly, the scene comprises Charlie getting a French damsel into hot water by using her dwelling as a hiding spot. He is then obliged to bail her out, and, during this, he captures the German monarch as well. He achieves this by impersonating a german colonizer or similar. It's enjoyable when Charlie is asked something in German, and he responds with no no no. The serviceman glances at him amusingly, causing Charlie to change his response to: yes yes yes! The ruler is captured, and Charlie is hailed a hero... however, he wakes up again at the training camp, it was merely a charming dream!<br /><br />Charlie played out such 'vision sequences' earlier too (The Bank is an example) but no matter, the film was so amusing it made me laugh non-stop. Chaplin also delivers a statement with this film (as subsequent work began addressing broader societal commentary on various world mishaps) encapsulated best in the film's final line: 'Peace on earth, good will to all mankind.'<br /><br />To sum up: a Chaplin masterpiece, immensely comical, everlasting. 9/10.

Magnificent Chaplin show containing myriad remarkable occurrences as Charlie becomes part of the army to combat in the First World War.<br /><br />At the onset, he lands up in military camp, where he must learn to maneuver his weapon and march in sync. This is indeed a hilarious episode because the drifter is unaccustomed to having aligned steps!<br /><br />In no time, he's in a trench in France. Here, humorous sequences comprise a hunger-stricken Charlie devouring the cheese stuck on a mousetrap, and peeking at a letter from his hometown over a comrade's shoulder.<br /><br />As he prepares to sleep, Charlie discovers his shelter completely drenched with his roomie snoring unabatedly. This segment is purely comedic! It's challenging to put in words – it's better to view the film instead. As Charlie wakes, he feels his legs are numb, hence, he attempts to 'animate them.' It was a riot when it was revealed that his other leg still feels numb... while Charlie is, in reality, rubbing his comrade's foot!<br /><br />Subsequently, the film adopts a slightly darker tone when Charlie takes down a few Germans from his trench (albeit in a comical style) and disguises as a tree to approach the enemy lines, rescuing his friend from a death brigade.<br /><br />The concluding scenes feature Charlie getting a French maiden into a sticky situation by hiding in her abode. Consequently, he has to rescue her and during this episode, he captures the German sovereign too. He accomplishes this by posing as a German commander or something akin. It's amusing when Charlie is queried in German, and his first reaction is no no no. The infantryman observes him in an amusing manner, prompting Charlie to amend his answer to: yes yes yes! The sovereign is seized, and Charlie turns into a hero... but subsequently, he wakes up again in military camp, realizing it was just a delightful dream!<br /><br />Charlie implemented these 'dream-like scenarios' previously (The Bank being an illustration), but it's irrelevant, the film was so comedic it had me in splits throughout. Chaplin also conveys a message through this film (as further works dove deeper into social commentary on numerous global disasters) best articulated in the movie's last quote: 'Peace on earth, good will to all mankind.'<br /><br />To encapsulate: a Chaplin classic, extraordinarily funny, ageless. 9/10.

text: It's characteristic of individuals griping about an issue while they are utterly ignorant about it... Hence, this tale revolves around a homosexual man being attracted to a heterosexual female. To begin with... This is based on actual events so there's no claiming its implausible. Secondly, it's authored by a homosexual male so the notion that this is anti-gay is absolutely absurd. I personally believe this is the finest romance narrative I've ever witnessed. And I strongly support gay rights. I believe this demonstrates that genuine love revolves around characteristics, not just appearances and sexual relations. And it poses no prejudice against anyone gay, straight or bisexual unlike numerous other programmes. Perhaps we in Europe relate to it more since most TV here is a little profound and induces deeper contemplation than American TV... Plus, we side-step any qualms when it comes to depicting specific scenarios.<br /><br />If you're in search of something hilarious featuring one of England's top-notch (Lesley Sharp) and you desire to witness a credible romance without excessive mushiness, this is your pick. I know I am fond of it.

text: It's commonplace for folks to grumble about matters they are entirely clueless about... Thus, this is a narrative about a gay guy who is smitten by a straight lady. To start with... This narrative is based on real-life incidents so one cannot dismiss it as unconvincing. Moreover, it's penned by a gay individual so any argument suggesting this is against the LGBTQ+ community is simple nonsense. Personally, I'm of the opinion that this is the greatest love saga I've ever come across. And I'm staunchly pro-LGBTQ+. I assume this portrays that true affection is based on personality rather than just physical attractiveness and sexual activity. Furthermore, it doesn't have anything detrimental against someone who is gay, straight or bisexual unlike various other shows. Maybe we Europeans resonate more with this since our television content tends to be slightly more profound and stimulates more introspection compared to American TV... Plus, we exhibit no apprehensions when it comes to showcasing specific issues.<br /><br />If you're keen on finding something comic with one of England's finest (Lesley Sharp) and want to immerse in an authentic love story without an overload of sentimentality, this is meant for you. I am certain that I adore it.

text: It’s quite usual for people to grumble about topics they are completely uninformed about… Therefore, this revolves around a gay male who develops feelings for a heterosexual female. To begin with... this is a tale inspired by real-life incidents hence it's impossible to label it as unrealistic. Also, it's crafted by a gay individual thereby any conjectures about its being anti-gay are utterly baseless. Personally, I regard this as the most impressive love narrative I've ever experienced. Moreover, I'm a strong supporter of gay rights. I feel that this illustrates that true affection is centred around one's personality rather than just physical appeal and physical intimacy. It doesn't harbour any negativity against a person who is gay, straight or bisexual unlike a slew of other series. Perhaps we, in Europe, connect to it more as our television content is slightly more introspective and provokes deeper thinking than American TV...

text: It is to typical of people complaining about something when they no nothing about it...So this is about a gay man falling for a straight women. First of all...This is a true story so you cant say its not believable Second its written by a gay man so the whole thing about this being against the gays are just plain stupid. Personally I think this was the best love story I've ever seen. And I am very pro gay. I think this shows that real love is about personality not just looks and sex. And it has nothing against anyone who is gay, straight or bi unlike so many other shows. Maybe we in Europe take to it more cus most TV here are a bit deeper and make you think more then American TV...Plus we don't fear when it comes to showing certain things.<br /><br />If you want something funny with one of Englands best (Lesley Sharp) and you want to see a decent believable love story without too much sap this is for you.

label: 1 (positive)","text: It's characteristic of individuals griping about an issue while they are utterly ignorant about it... Hence, this tale revolves around a homosexual man being attracted to a heterosexual female. To begin with... This is based on actual events so there's no claiming its implausible. Secondly, it's authored by a homosexual male so the notion that this is anti-gay is absolutely absurd. I personally believe this is the finest romance narrative I've ever witnessed. And I strongly support gay rights. I believe this demonstrates that genuine love revolves around characteristics, not just appearances and sexual relations. And it poses no prejudice against anyone gay, straight or bisexual unlike numerous other programmes. Perhaps we in Europe relate to it more since most TV here is a little profound and induces deeper contemplation than American TV... Plus, we side-step any qualms when it comes to depicting specific scenarios.<br /><br />If you're in search of something hilarious featuring one of England's top-notch (Lesley Sharp) and you desire to witness a credible romance without excessive mushiness, this is your pick. I know I am fond of it.
label: 1 (positive)","text: It's commonplace for folks to grumble about matters they are entirely clueless about... Thus, this is a narrative about a gay guy who is smitten by a straight lady. To start with... This narrative is based on real-life incidents so one cannot dismiss it as unconvincing. Moreover, it's penned by a gay individual so any argument suggesting this is against the LGBTQ+ community is simple nonsense. Personally, I'm of the opinion that this is the greatest love saga I've ever come across. And I'm staunchly pro-LGBTQ+. I assume this portrays that true affection is based on personality rather than just physical attractiveness and sexual activity. Furthermore, it doesn't have anything detrimental against someone who is gay, straight or bisexual unlike various other shows. Maybe we Europeans resonate more with this since our television content tends to be slightly more profound and stimulates more introspection compared to American TV... Plus, we exhibit no apprehensions when it comes to showcasing specific issues.<br /><br />If you're keen on finding something comic with one of England's finest (Lesley Sharp) and want to immerse in an authentic love story without an overload of sentimentality, this is meant for you. I am certain that I adore it.

To begin with... this is a tale inspired by real-life incidents hence it's impossible to label it as unrealistic. Also, it's crafted by a gay individual thereby any conjectures about its being anti-gay are utterly baseless. Personally, I regard this as the most impressive love narrative I've ever experienced. Moreover, I'm a strong supporter of gay rights. I feel that this illustrates that true affection is centred around one's personality rather than just physical appeal and physical intimacy. It doesn't harbour any negativity against a person who is gay, straight or bisexual unlike a slew of other series. Perhaps we, in Europe, connect to it more as our television content is slightly more introspective and provokes deeper thinking than American TV...

It's also important to notice that if you shoot someone with a pistol (probably only happens on planes) that person is kicked back in the air.

There are countless issues i could point out about the film that i could nearly compose a text on how much the film is awful. For one, there were approximately 50 individuals on the aircraft, they slaughtered about 100 and they kept emerging, it seems the ""infection"" causes liver problems as everyone had yellowish eyes, also the infection causes individuals to growl like big cats or something, and the infection not only mends tissue but it also grants enhanced human strength, not forgetting that this infection jumbles up human's hair. It's likewise crucial to observe that if you fire someone with a handgun (only happens on aircrafts) that individual is thrown back in midair. Remember that if you are accompanying a criminal on an aircraft and you misplace him, always check within the compartments and closets the size of a flask, you can never predict where those villains are going to conceal.

It's also vital to recognise that if you shoot an individual with a revolver (mainly happens on planes) that individual is flung back in the atmosphere. Remember that if you are guiding a convict on a plane and you lose him, always examine inside the drawers and lockers the size of a jar, you never fathom where those rogues are going to seclude.

It's also necessary to note that if you assail a person with a firearm (presumably only transpires on jets) that person is propelled back in the ether. Keep in mind that if you are convoying a felon on a jet and you mislay him, always inspect inside the cupboards and casings the size of a decanter, you never discern where those scoundrels are going to obscure.

These people couldn't articulate emotion out of a paper bag. The script doesn't back them up either. Ridiculous lines, and I can only guess there was no guidance from the director. this script was delivered like Shakespeare in high school with a tutor whipping them as they progressed.<br /><br />while this motion picture (if you could define it that at its 80 min. runtime (thankfully)) is perhaps even more comical than the premier due to all these aspects, it is unquestionably more distressing to view. 1/10.

Observing the promotional graphics of the Bill nowadays, more often than not, portray a couple of officers in a romantic grasp or some relationship nuances as opposed to crime-focused scenarios depicted in its older promotional imagery. This evident shift indicates a major deviation from its original, incredible cop show vibe to a more typical TV drama. Watching it now feels like viewing a law enforcement variation of Coronation Street or alike.

text: I habitually appreciated The Bill for its excellent scripts and character dynamics but of recent it feels as though it's transformed into a tear-jerking soap. Glance at recent promotional snaps or posters of The Bill, they prominently feature either an affectionate moment between two officers or other relationship-oriented themes as opposed to a criminal incident captured in promotional images in the past. This contrast strongly implies how much it has deviated from a superb police-based show to an average type of TV soap opera. Watching it now seems akin to a police variant of Coronation Street or related shows. While I admit I continue to enjoy The Bill due to my interest in law enforcement, I sincerely lament the exceptional charm The Bill used to showcase. I'd wish to score it as 2 out of ten given the devastation brought about by the recent management of the show.<br /><br />As for the script and character developments, they both seem to have gone into a decline, most of the splendid characters have already departed, although some remain, in my judgment. I’m not suggesting the fresh crop of characters are substandard because they are certainly not, but they seem to lack the hardy appearance, unique personas and engaging dialogues that all of the previous characters had since most of them are caught up in trifling romances and family predicaments lately.<br /><br />On the whole, being one of the scant police shows on air, The Bill remains a poorly intriguing program, although it has clearly lost much of its novelty and is now unfairly ranked as an abominable, unrealistic TV drama.<br /><br />Worth tuning in for some amusement at the ineptitude of the onscreen police officers - 2/10.

text: I perpetually admired The Bill credited to its splendid manuscript and personas, but recently it appears to have transitioned into an emotional soap opera style. A look at promotional imagery of The Bill nowadays typically reveals two officers in an intimate embrace or other relational themes, unlike crime communicated through old promotional pictures. This contrast starkly suggests it has drifted from being a phenomenal police-centric drama to morphing into a customary television soap opera. Experiencing it now feels more like an encounter with a law enforcement edition of Coronation Street or similar. Despite these changes, I maintain my fondness for The Bill because I'm drawn to the law enforcement narrative, but I genuinely yearn for the superlative aura it once possessed. I lean towards assigning a low a score of 2 out of ten, conceding the significant damage caused by the team that assumed control of the show.<br /><br />The plot and character progressions too have suffered a downtrend, the stronger characters from earlier have mostly disappeared, albeit a few linger, to my belief. I'm not asserting that new characters lack quality, for they surely do not, however they seem to be missing the hardened appearances, compelling characters, and narrations the bygone characters boasted, given their current entanglement in petty love affairs and domestic strife.<br /><br />In summary, being one of the scarce police dramas on television today, The Bill yet offers a poorly engaging watch, though it has significantly compromised its distinctiveness, leading it to be unfairly pigeonholed as an abysmal, fantastical television drama.<br /><br />Recommended for a jovial time over the clumsiness of the featured police officers - 2/10.

I'd wish to score it as 2 out of ten given the devastation brought about by the recent management of the show.<br /><br />As for the script and character developments, they both seem to have gone into a decline, most of the splendid characters have already departed, although some remain, in my judgment. I’m not suggesting the fresh crop of characters are substandard because they are certainly not, but they seem to lack the hardy appearance, unique personas and engaging dialogues that all of the previous characters had since most of them are caught up in trifling romances and family predicaments lately.<br /><br />On the whole, being one of the scant police shows on air, The Bill remains a poorly intriguing program, although it has clearly lost much of its novelty and is now unfairly ranked as an abominable, unrealistic TV drama.<br /><br />Worth tuning in for some amusement at the ineptitude of the onscreen police officers - 2/10.
label: 0 (negative)","text: I perpetually admired The Bill credited to its splendid manuscript and personas, but recently it appears to have transitioned into an emotional soap opera style. A look at promotional imagery of The Bill nowadays typically reveals two officers in an intimate embrace or other relational themes, unlike crime communicated through old promotional pictures. This contrast starkly suggests it has drifted from being a phenomenal police-centric drama to morphing into a customary television soap opera. Experiencing it now feels more like an encounter with a law enforcement edition of Coronation Street or similar. Despite these changes, I maintain my fondness for The Bill because I'm drawn to the law enforcement narrative, but I genuinely yearn for the superlative aura it once possessed. I lean towards assigning a low a score of 2 out of ten, conceding the significant damage caused by the team that assumed control of the show.<br /><br />The plot and character progressions too have suffered a downtrend, the stronger characters from earlier have mostly disappeared, albeit a few linger, to my belief. I'm not asserting that new characters lack quality, for they surely do not, however they seem to be missing the hardened appearances, compelling characters, and narrations the bygone characters boasted, given their current entanglement in petty love affairs and domestic strife.<br /><br />In summary, being one of the scarce police dramas on television today, The Bill yet offers a poorly engaging watch, though it has significantly compromised its distinctiveness, leading it to be unfairly pigeonholed as an abysmal, fantastical television drama.<br /><br />Recommended for a jovial time over the clumsiness of the featured police officers - 2/10.
label: 0 (negative)","text: I used to always love the bill because of its great script and characters, but lately i feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap. If you look at promotional pictures/posters of the bill now you will see either two of the officers hugging/kissing or something to do with friendships whereas promotional pictures of the bill a long time ago would have shown something to do with crime. This proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing Police drama to an average type of television soap. When i watch it i feel like I'm watching a police version of Coronation Street or something similar. I have to say i still like the bill as I'm interested in Police work and that type of thing but i really miss the greatness that The Bill used to have. I want to rate it as 2 out of ten because you have to admit it has been totally ruined by the people who took the bill over.<br /><br />As for the script and characters they have both gone downhill, most of the great characters are gone now (although a few still remain i think) and I'm not saying that the newer characters are poor or anything because they definitely aren't, its just that they lack the tough looks, personalities and script lines that all of the old characters used to have because most of the new ones are at the moment involved with silly relationships and family trouble.<br /><br />Overall being one of the only Police programs on television these days, The Bill will always be a crappily interesting thing to watch, but like i say it has lost a lot of its uniqueness (if thats the right spelling) and would now be classed as a terrible, unreal television soap.<br /><br />Recommended to watch for a good laugh over the stupidity of the police officers involved - 2/10

text: As far as I'm aware, this was my initial encounter with Icelandic films. It's quite refreshing to see something different from the usual Hollywood feature film. It's unfortunate that films like this one have a slim chance of achieving success in the global industry. I can only wish that people come across this inadvertently, through referrals or otherwise...<br /><br />For it's truly worthwhile. I departed the theatre feeling extremely melancholic. I was unable to remove the heart-rending fates of the characters from my mind. Furthermore, I was even more fascinated when I contemplated the intricacy of the film. It wasn't simply a sorrowful narrative, it had outstanding comedic interludes and an outstanding soundtrack.<br /><br />If you get the chance, view it! It's incredibly stimulating and caused me to reflect deeply.<br /><br />

text: To the best of my knowledge, this was my premiere interaction with Icelandic cinema. It's a breath of fresh air to view something divergent from the typical Hollywood flick. It's a pity that productions like this one possess a minimal probability of prosperity in the overarching industry. My only aspiration is that individuals encounter this by happenstance, via suggestion or otherwise...<br /><br />As it is definitely of value. I exited the movie theatre imbued with intense sorrow. I couldn't free my thoughts from the terrible destinies of the personae. It astounded me even further when I considered the complexity within the film. It wasn't just a tragic tale, it featured superior humorous breaks and a remarkable soundtrack.<br /><br />If the opportunity presents itself, watch it! It's truly a thought stimulator and induced substantial contemplation within me.<br /><br />

text: To my understanding, this was my inaugural introduction to Icelandic motion pictures. It's a welcome change to witness something unique from the ordinary Hollywood screen production. It's regrettable that creations like this one bear a scarce likelihood of thriving in the large scale sector. All I can hope is that audiences discover this unintentionally, through endorsement or otherwise...<br /><br />Since it's genuinely worthy. I departed the theatre imbued with deep desolation. I was incapable of expelling the tragic destinies of the characters from my consciousness. It amazed me even more when I reflected upon the film's complexity. It was not solely a heart-breaking narrative, it also boasted excellent humor-infused intermissions and an extraordinary musical accompaniment.<br /><br />Given the chance, do watch it! It's profoundly thought-inducing and elicited substantial introspection.<br /><br />

It's unfortunate that films like this one have a slim chance of achieving success in the global industry. I can only wish that people come across this inadvertently, through referrals or otherwise...<br /><br />For it's truly worthwhile. I departed the theatre feeling extremely melancholic. I was unable to remove the heart-rending fates of the characters from my mind. Furthermore, I was even more fascinated when I contemplated the intricacy of the film. It wasn't simply a sorrowful narrative, it had outstanding comedic interludes and an outstanding soundtrack.<br /><br />If you get the chance, view it! It's incredibly stimulating and caused me to reflect deeply.<br /><br />

It's a breath of fresh air to view something divergent from the typical Hollywood flick. It's a pity that productions like this one possess a minimal probability of prosperity in the overarching industry. My only aspiration is that individuals encounter this by happenstance, via suggestion or otherwise...<br /><br />As it is definitely of value. I exited the movie theatre imbued with intense sorrow. I couldn't free my thoughts from the terrible destinies of the personae. It astounded me even further when I considered the complexity within the film. It wasn't just a tragic tale, it featured superior humorous breaks and a remarkable soundtrack.<br /><br />If the opportunity presents itself, watch it!

It's regrettable that creations like this one bear a scarce likelihood of thriving in the large scale sector. All I can hope is that audiences discover this unintentionally, through endorsement or otherwise...<br /><br />Since it's genuinely worthy. I departed the theatre imbued with deep desolation. I was incapable of expelling the tragic destinies of the characters from my consciousness. It amazed me even more when I reflected upon the film's complexity. It was not solely a heart-breaking narrative, it also boasted excellent humor-infused intermissions and an extraordinary musical accompaniment.<br /><br />Given the chance, do watch it!

text: Every so often, a film emerges purely by chance that makes you question your mental stability. We have just concluded examining the book ""Northanger Abbey"" at our educational institution and decided to jog our memories of this unimpressive fragment of humorless junk with the adoption by BBC.<br /><br />The laughable factor about Northanger Abbey is that it genuinely prompts you to think about self-destruction. The film is in no way like the book, for example, the mildly malicious entities seem to have morphed into evident clichés. John Thorpe appears as a hallucinating gnome while Isabella takes on the role of a courtesan. Catherine, the central character, is the most depressingly unintelligent and annoying performer on divine's territory (she looks like a coffee fanatic, her eyes are akin to basketballs) while Mr Tilney looks and behaves as a pensioned off X-rated movie double. The plot veers completely off course at specific parts of the movie, I have no idea what the director was contemplating when out of the blue, a 7 year old Afro child, whom we've never encountered before, removes the protagonist from the abbey and begins to tumble in front of her. Yes, that's true, tumbling. Bizarre scenes of this nature are occasionally intervened with Catherine's ""fantasies"" where she is being transported around a cathedral by a beast.<br /><br />Northanger Abbey is essentially optical euthanasia so if you desire to execute your supervisor or something of that sort, BBC have undoubtedly discovered a new technique to cause someone's death. Northanger is a marginally comedic lousy movie. Refrain from viewing it unless you're in a padded chamber.

The plot entirely loses track at some junctures in the film, I can't fathom what on earth the director had in mind when unexpectedly, a 7 year old African kid, whom we've never seen before, escorts the lead role away from the abbey and initiates doing flips in front of her. Yes, indeed, flips. Senseless actions of this sort are sporadically interrupted by Catherine's ""fantasies"" where she is seen being lifted around a cathedral by a brute.<br /><br />Northanger Abbey is essentially visible euthanasia so if you're planning to terminate your manager or something similar, BBC has essentially discovered a new mode to end someone's life. Northanger is a barely comedic terrible film. Avoid watching it unless you're in a padded enclosure.
label: 0 (negative)","text: Every so often, a film emerges purely by chance that makes you question your mental stability. We have just concluded examining the book ""Northanger Abbey"" at our educational institution and decided to jog our memories of this unimpressive fragment of humorless junk with the adoption by BBC.<br /><br />The laughable factor about Northanger Abbey is that it genuinely prompts you to think about self-destruction. The film is in no way like the book, for example, the mildly malicious entities seem to have morphed into evident clichés. John Thorpe appears as a hallucinating gnome while Isabella takes on the role of a courtesan. Catherine, the central character, is the most depressingly unintelligent and annoying performer on divine's territory (she looks like a coffee fanatic, her eyes are akin to basketballs) while Mr Tilney looks and behaves as a pensioned off X-rated movie double. The plot veers completely off course at specific parts of the movie, I have no idea what the director was contemplating when out of the blue, a 7 year old Afro child, whom we've never encountered before, removes the protagonist from the abbey and begins to tumble in front of her. Yes, that's true, tumbling. Bizarre scenes of this nature are occasionally intervened with Catherine's ""fantasies"" where she is being transported around a cathedral by a beast.<br /><br />Northanger Abbey is essentially optical euthanasia so if you desire to execute your supervisor or something of that sort, BBC have undoubtedly discovered a new technique to cause someone's death. Northanger is a marginally comedic lousy movie. Refrain from viewing it unless you're in a padded chamber.
label: 0 (negative)","text: Now and again, a film comes around purely by accident that makes you doubt your sanity. We just finished studying the novel, ""Northanger Abbey"", at school and decided to refresh our memory of this unexciting piece of humourless garbage with the BBC adaptation.<br /><br />The funny thing about Northanger Abbey is that it actually makes you want to kill yourself. The film is NOTHING like the book, for example, the subtly evil characters seem to have been turned into transparent stereotypes. John Thorpe looks like a leprechaun on acid while Isabella plays the role of slut. Catherine, the main character, is the most depressingly stupid and irritating actress on god's earth (she looks like a coffee addict, her eyes are like basketballs) whilst Mr Tilney looks and acts like a retired porno stunt double. The plot goes completely off the rails at certain points of the film, I don't know what the hell the director was thinking when for no reason at all, a 7 year old black kid who we've never met before takes the main character out of the abbey and starts cartwheeling in front of her. Yes, that's right, cartwheeling. Nonsense of this kind is occasionally interrupted by Catherines ""fantasies"" in which she is being carried around a cathedral by an ogre.<br /><br />Northanger Abbey is basically visual euthanasia so if you want to murder your boss or something like that, BBC have basically discovered a new way to kill someone. Northanger is a barely laughably bad film. Don't watch it unless you're in a padded cell.

text: I viewed Pola X because Scott Walker contributed the film's soundtrack and I greatly respect his musical works. Honestly, I anticipated a somewhat grandiose and possibly disjointed French film. I was mistaken. The film's vision rapidly succeeded in captivating my interest to the maximum - commencing with the initial scene, which displays monochrome footage of warplanes dropping bombs on cemeteries to the tunes of music and Scott Walker's magnificent lamenting vocals. The film delves into the identity turmoil of Pierre (Guillaume Depardieu - a superb selection for the character) and his resultant (self-)annihilation. The plot is bifurcated into two segments - the first illustrates Pierre's nonchalant existence in a splendid home in the French rural area and the second observes his complete personal degradation after he forsakes everything and relocates to Paris to exist in destitution with his alleged half-sibling. Both segments encapsulate some incredibly breathtaking cinematography - the first incredibly vivid and radiant, the second profoundly dark and bordering on apocalyptic - culminating in a genuine visual spectacle. Pola X is a mesmerizing and quite distinctive cinematic experience.

text: I screened Pola X because Scott Walker crafted the movie score and I esteem his tunes immensely. Candidly, I foresaw a somewhat pompous and potentially nebulous French motion picture. I erred. The projection of the film swiftly worked to seize my focus utterly - beginning with the starting sequence, which portrays greyscale footage of combat jets disgorging explosives on burial grounds to the strains of music and Scott Walker's exquisite plaintive voice. The movie probes the identity quandary of Pierre (Guillaume Depardieu - an exceptional pick for the part) and his ensuing (self-)devastation. The narrative is split into two components - the first conveys Pierre's unfettered living in a lovely residence in the French countryside and the second trails his total personal breakup after he renounces everything and migrates to Paris to dwell in poverty with his assumed half-sister. Both components include some astoundingly beautiful imagery - the first exceedingly vibrant and luminous, the second wholly dismal and nearly catastrophic - amounting to a bona fide aesthetic banquet. Pola X is a captivating and quite exceptional film viewing.

text: I observed Pola X because Scott Walker fashioned the cinematic soundtrack and I highly regard his melodies. Frankly, I predicted a somewhat ostentatious and possibly muddled French flick. I misjudged. The conception of the movie speedily engaged my concentration completely - initiating with the preamble sequence, which represents achromatic footage of martial aircrafts launching explosives at cemeteries to the sounds of music and Scott Walker's splendidly sorrowful howl. The flick scrutinizes the identity conundrum of Pierre (Guillaume Depardieu - an excellent option for the role) and his subsequent (self-)ruin. The tale is partitioned into two sections - the first portrays Pierre's light-hearted existence in an attractive abode in the French provinces and the second tracks his absolute personal collapse after he discards everything and shifts to Paris to suffer in misery with his purported half-sister. Both sections encompass some remarkably enchanting visuals - the first is intensely colorful and shining, the second is utterly bleak and almost apocalyptic - accumulated in an authentic aesthetic gala. Pola X is a gripping and quite unusual film encounter.

text: I watched Pola X because Scott Walker composed the film score and I admire his music a lot. Frankly, I expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent French movie. I was wrong. The vision of the film quickly managed to engage my attention to the fullest - starting with the opening sequence, which shows black and white footage of military airplanes throwing bombs at graves at the sounds of music and Scott Walker's beautiful wailing voice. The film explores the identity crisis of Pierre (Guillaume Depardieu - a brilliant choice for the role) and his consequential (self-)destruction. The story is divided into two parts  the first depicts Pierre's carefree life in a beautiful house in the French countryside and the second follows his utter personal disintegration after he abandons everything and moves to Paris to live in squalor with his supposed half-sister. Both parts contain some amazingly stunning photography  the first very colorful and bright, the second utterly gloomy and nearly apocalyptic - adding up to a true aesthetic feast. Pola X is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience.
label: 1 (positive)","text: I viewed Pola X because Scott Walker contributed the film's soundtrack and I greatly respect his musical works. Honestly, I anticipated a somewhat grandiose and possibly disjointed French film. I was mistaken. The film's vision rapidly succeeded in captivating my interest to the maximum - commencing with the initial scene, which displays monochrome footage of warplanes dropping bombs on cemeteries to the tunes of music and Scott Walker's magnificent lamenting vocals. The film delves into the identity turmoil of Pierre (Guillaume Depardieu - a superb selection for the character) and his resultant (self-)annihilation. The plot is bifurcated into two segments - the first illustrates Pierre's nonchalant existence in a splendid home in the French rural area and the second observes his complete personal degradation after he forsakes everything and relocates to Paris to exist in destitution with his alleged half-sibling. Both segments encapsulate some incredibly breathtaking cinematography - the first incredibly vivid and radiant, the second profoundly dark and bordering on apocalyptic - culminating in a genuine visual spectacle. Pola X is a mesmerizing and quite distinctive cinematic experience.

Candidly, I foresaw a somewhat pompous and potentially nebulous French motion picture. I erred. The projection of the film swiftly worked to seize my focus utterly - beginning with the starting sequence, which portrays greyscale footage of combat jets disgorging explosives on burial grounds to the strains of music and Scott Walker's exquisite plaintive voice. The movie probes the identity quandary of Pierre (Guillaume Depardieu - an exceptional pick for the part) and his ensuing (self-)devastation. The narrative is split into two components - the first conveys Pierre's unfettered living in a lovely residence in the French countryside and the second trails his total personal breakup after he renounces everything and migrates to Paris to dwell in poverty with his assumed half-sister. Both components include some astoundingly beautiful imagery - the first exceedingly vibrant and luminous, the second wholly dismal and nearly catastrophic - amounting to a bona fide aesthetic banquet. Pola X is a captivating and quite exceptional film viewing.

"I viewed my videotape last night, for the first time in at least ten years. I found the work itself and the performances just as gripping as they were in my memory. George Hearn, of course,was the master of the role of Sweeney; there is never a touch of softness in his determination to wreak vengeance on those he believes caused his wife's death and his daughter's disappearance; at least not until the end, when he discovers that his thirst for revenge has led him to murder his wife. Angela Lansbury, on the other hand, creates a more complex portrayal, as Mrs. Lovett. She understood that Sondheim wanted that role to be something of a ""comic"" counterpart to Sweeney; and even brings some tenderness into her courtship of Sweeney and her nurture of the boy Tobias.

Naturally, George Hearn was the authority in his portrayal of Sweeney; his conviction to seek retribution on those he perceived as responsible for his wife's demise and his daughter's vanishing was unyieldingly stern; not until the climax when he realizes his rage for retribution has caused him to kill his wife. Contrarily, Angela Lansbury offers a multifaceted depiction as Mrs. Lovett. She comprehended that Sondheim intended for her character to be a bit of a ""humorous"" counterpart to Sweeney; she even infuses gentleness in her pursuit of Sweeney and in the care of the young Tobias. To those who reminisce, this enactment harkens back to her initial performances in The Picture of Dorian Grey and Gaslight; well prior to Murder, She Wrote. Merely a year prior, I witnessed the musical at Lyric Opera of Chicago, with Brynn Terfel, then a rising opera star, as Sweeney. Some have remarked on the opera-like quality of the music. I deduce that ""Sweeney"" is effectively conveyed by actors capable of at minimum, carrying the vocal parts, rather than opera artistes with restricted acting abilities. Finally, I applaud the individual who portrayed Tobias, with his conflicting allegiances and lack of understanding about his surroundings.

text: I observed my tape playback yesterday evening, the premier occurrence after approximately a span of ten years. The composition and the residencies were equally arresting as they etched in my reminiscence. George Hearn was irrefutably the expert of his rendition of Sweeney; always unflinchingly resolute in his quest to avenge from those whom he assumes to be the culprits for his wife's casualty and his daughter's vanishment; at least not until the culminating point, wherein he discovers that his revengeful cravings have driven him to assassinate his spouse. In contrast, Angela Lansbury, in the role of Mrs. Lovett, offers a nuanced interpretation. She recognized that Sondheim wanted the character to present a 'comic' counter-role to Sweeney; even lends a touch of warmth in her solicitation of Sweeney and fostering Tobias. Those with an old memory, this representation drifts you back to her maiden showcases in The Picture of Dorian Grey and Gaslight, well before Murder, She Wrote appeared. Exactly a year past, I was present for the musical at Lyric Opera of Chicago, starring then, the current opera sensation Brynn Terfel as Sweeney. A few have noted the music's operatic texture. My inference is that ""Sweeney"" excels more with thespians who can at least deliver the vocal lines, rather than opera singers who have bounded acting prowess. In closing, I extol the actor personifying Tobias with his torn allegiances and bewilderment about the surrounding proceedings. It seemed fit that he almost had the last say.

Angela Lansbury, opposingly, crafts a more compound delineation as Mrs. Lovett. She fathomed that Sondheim envisaged her role as somewhat a ""comical"" foil to Sweeney; additionally, she even inserts some kindness in her wooing of Sweeney and fostering of Tobias.

She understood that Sondheim wanted that role to be something of a ""comic"" counterpart to Sweeney; and even brings some tenderness into her courtship of Sweeney and her nurture of the boy Tobias. For those with long memories, this performance takes one back to her debut performances in The Picture of Dorian Grey and Gaslight; long before Murder, She Wrote. Only a year ago I saw the musical at Lyric Opera of Chicago. with current opera superstar Brynn Terfel as Sweeney. Others have commented on the operatic quality of the score. My conclusion is that ""Sweeney"" works better with actors who can at least handle the vocal lines, than with opera performers who have limited acting skills. As a final note, I commend the performer who portrayed Tobias. with his mixed loyalties and confusion about what is going on around him. It seemed appropriate that he had virtually the last word.

Of course this bio also includes commentary by fans (make of that what you will).<br /><br />Davies was a very attractive young woman, and by all accounts a terrific comedienne in real life.<br /><br />And because a part of her anatomy added immeasurably to the real-life answer to Joseph Cotten's character's search for the meaning behind Kane's final word in the opening scene of the great ""Citizen Kane,"" she's earned her spot among the great stories if Hollywood's history.<br /><br />But I think Welles & Mankiewicz got it right for the most part with the ""Susan Alexander"" facsimile of the real article.<br /><br />Don't bother voting as to whether you agree or disagree with this post as I really couldn't care less.

text: Mr Baseball proved to be an entertaining video lease with my betrothed Susan Nauss. Susan expressed her eager anticipation to watch the film. The role of a stern yet honourable Coach by Ken Takakura Oda fits perfectly. Having done numerous remarkable Asian movies, I differ with one critic and assert Takakura's continued Cinematic Significance with works like Hotari. Everyone seems to appreciate Tom Selleck, however, Ken Takakura surpasses him in the field of dramatic acting. Today somebody tagged me as a Yakuza, so to clarify I maintain that my Honorable Uncle Shadow Chief Jack F Kennedy, myself and others constitute the lawful Homo Sapien leadership in our Cosmos and due to our mutual creators, humans are free beings combating the different forms of adversity spoken about by Chief Kennedy in his inaugural speech. In all honesty, someone has ensured amiably low food prices in Canada for staples like bread. In respect to our mutual creators, I plead everyone to refrain from consuming amphibians, reptiles and eggs. I am optimistic that eventually a follow-up to Mr Baseball will transpire with Father Ken Takakura Oda resuming his role as Coach. I am grateful to IMDb for endorsing the freedom of speech, of the kind that President George W Bush and I support. Back IMDb.

text: Mr Baseball was an enjoyable video hire with my Engaged partner Susan Nauss. Susan revealed she had been enthusiastically awaiting the film's release. Casting Ken Takakura Oda as a rigid but Ethical Coach was astute. Given Takakura's repertoire of splendid Asian films, I respectfully disagree with one critic and vouch for Takakura's sustained Cinema Impact with releases like Hotari. Though Tom Selleck has a universal appeal, it's Ken Takakura who triumphs as a superior dramatic performer. Today I was referred to as a Yakuza, I retaliate by asserting that My Esteemed Uncle Shadow Leader Jack F Kennedy, myself, and others form the lawful human governance in our Galaxy and due to our co-makers, Homo Sapiens persist as liberated beings confronting every aspect of hardship that Leader Kennedy addressed in his maiden speech. It's worth acknowledging that someone has maintained impressively low food costs in Canada for essential items like bread. With due respect to our co-makers, I implore cessation of consumption of amphibians, reptiles, and eggs. My wish is that Mr Baseball's sequel will materialize with Father Ken Takakura Oda reprising as Coach.

text: Crackerjack is a further traditional Australian flick. Just as countless Aussie films such as The Castle, The Dish and Sunday Too Far Away, it ventures into an area that hasn't been conventionally scrutinized in film before, in this instance it's the sport of Lawn Bowls and bowling clubs. Crackerjack is a decelerated sports movie compared to most others such as Remember the Titians or Million Dollar Baby, but the personas partaking are sportsmen and sportswomen in their own merit. The film illustrates a substantial aspect of Australian tradition and highlights a game that's in vogue and growing in popularity across Australia. Mick Molloy portrays a memorable, classic role. It's indisputably a must watch.

text: Crackerjack is yet another vintage film from Australia. Just like numerous Australian cinematic pieces like The Castle, The Dish and Sunday Too Far Away, it navigates in a direction that's not thoroughly probed in movies prior, this occasion it is the pastime of Lawn Bowls and bowling clubs. Crackerjack is a more measured sports film compared to numerous others you will come across such as Remember the Titans or Million Dollar Baby, yet the characters involved are competitors in their own individual capacity.

"Clearly this film was made for a newer generation that may or may not have had an inkling of Charles Bukowski's work. The autobiographical Henry Chinaski character in Bukowski's stories was brilliantly portrayed to perfection by Mickey Rourke in 1987's 'Barfly', also starring Faye Dunaway. Anyone who has seen 'Factotum' should certainly see 'Barfly' to get a better look at how Bukowski wrote his character. 'Factotum' lacks the greasy seediness of Bukowski's screenplay and the fearless hopelessness of his loner hero. The inadvertent humor that bubbles through in the dark desperation of Chinaski's misadventures doesn't work for Dillon as it did so admirably for the overweight filthy blood-soaked Rourke. Rourke's character makes the pain and pleasure of the previous night's misbehavior a place-setting for yet another grueling ugly day in the life of a drunken misanthropic unknown writer. Dillon's character misses these marks in favor of a strutting, handsome, relatively clean-looking wanna-be writer that scarcely passes for any moment in that of Chinaski's story. Dunaway's sleazy heroine Wanda is the perfect complement to the ne'er-do-well Henry. The women in 'Factotum' can't hold a candle to Dunaway's 'distressed goddess' and the use of more profane sexual subject matter in 'Factotum' proves to be more of a crude distraction than a tip of the hat to Bukowski's raw and unapologetic portrayals of dysfunctional relationships. I was stunned at how many of the exact same scenes were used in 'Factotum' (Marisa Tomei buying all the stuff and charging it to the old man is an exact rip-off from 'Barfly').<br /><br />If you want to see the best Bukowski stories on film, see 'Barfly' and 'Love is a Dog From Hell' (which also goes by the title 'Crazy Love').",0 (negative),"text: Clearly this film was made for a newer generation that may or may not have had an inkling of Charles Bukowski's work.

text: Unmistakably, this motion picture was crafted for a fresh cohort that may have possibly had no slight suspicion of Charles Bukowski's oeuvre. The self-portrait Henry Chinaski persona in Bukowski's tales was splendidly performed flawlessly by Mickey Rourke in the 1987 film 'Barfly', co-starring Faye Dunaway. Anyone who has watched 'Factotum' should without doubt watch 'Barfly' to gain a deeper insight on how Bukowski composed his character. 'Factotum' lacks the oily low-life essence of Bukowski's script and the courageous despair of his lone hero. The unintentional humor that effervesces in the bleak desolation of Chinaski's misfortunes doesn't apply for Dillon as it did so impressively for the bulky dirty blood-drenched Rourke. Rourke's persona crafts the suffering and joy of the previous evening's misconduct a table-setting for yet another strenuous miserable day in the existence of a tipsy misanthropic anonymous author. Dillon's character overlooks these points in preference of an arrogant, attractive, fairly neat-looking aspirant author that barely accounts for any moment in that of Chinaski's tale. Dunaway's tawdry heroine Wanda is the idyllic attribute to the ne'er-do-well Henry. The ladies in 'Factotum' can't carry a torch to Dunaway's 'distressed deity' and the employment of more obscene sexual content in 'Factotum' appears to be more of a rough diversion than a nod to Bukowski's harsh and defiant portrayals of dysfunctional affairs. I was shocked at the number of identical scenarios depicted in 'Factotum' (Marisa Tomei acquiring all the goods and billing it to the elderly is a precise rip-off from 'Barfly'). <br /><br /> If you yearn to watch the prime Bukowski stories in cinema, watch 'Barfly' and 'Love is a Dog From Hell' (which also goes by the name 'Crazy Love').

text: Evidently, this movie was fabricated for a modern generation that could have or could not have had a trace of Charles Bukowski's creations. The autobiographic Henry Chinaski entity in Bukowski's narratives was phenomenally depicted to accuracy by Mickey Rourke in the 1987 production 'Barfly', starring alongside Faye Dunaway. Any individual who has viewed 'Factotum' should definitely watch 'Barfly' to have a refined perspective on how Bukowski authored his character. 'Factotum' misses out on the slick shabbiness of Bukowski's manuscript and the bold hopelessness of his solitary protagonist. The accidental comedy that springs out in the grim desperation of Chinaski's hardships doesn't fit Dillon as it did so commendably for the obese grimy blood-stained Rourke. Rourke's character fabricates the torture and delight of the preceding night's misdeeds a table-appointment for yet another challenging dreadful day in the life of a sozzled antisocial unrecognized writer. Dillon's character bypasses these benchmarks in favor of a confident, good-looking, moderately tidy-up-and-coming writer that hardly compensates for any instant in that of Chinaski's narrative. Dunaway's seedy heroine Wanda is the impeccable complement to the good-for-nothing Henry. The women in 'Factotum' can't compete with Dunaway's 'distressed divinity' and the utilization of more vulgar sexual situations in 'Factotum' tends to be more of a coarse distraction than a salute to Bukowski's stark and shameless representations of dysfunctional associations. I was astounded on noticing the number of equal scenes depicted in 'Factotum' (Marisa Tomei purchasing everything and invoicing it to the aged man is an exact plagiarize from 'Barfly'). <br /><br /> If you desire to witness the first-rate Bukowski tales on film, try 'Barfly' and 'Love is a Dog From Hell' (which also goes by the name 'Crazy Love').

The self-revealing Henry Chinaski figure in Bukowski's stories was strikingly characterized impeccably by Mickey Rourke in the 1987 display 'Barfly', complimenting Faye Dunaway. Any person who has observed 'Factotum' should certainly witness 'Barfly' to comprehend better how Bukowski constituted his character. 'Factotum' does not possess the grimy degeneracy of Bukowski's screenplay and the brave bleakness of his single hero. The accidental wit that flows in the dark despair of Chinaski's accidents does not suit Dillon as it did so capably for the overweight seedy bloodied Rourke. Rourke's figure fabricates the torment and ecstasy of the former night's wrongdoing a table arrangement for yet another brutal unsightly day in the existence of an intoxicated unsocial unknown scribe. Dillon's character disregards these indicators preferring a swaggering, appealing, decently clean-looking burgeoning author that just about covers any event in that of Chinaski's story. Dunaway's scurrilous heroine Wanda is the exact complement to the layabout Henry. The dames in 'Factotum' have no comparison to Dunaway's 'distressed goddess', and the employment of more indecent sexual subjects in 'Factotum' seems to be more of a vulgar diversion than a tribute to Bukowski's unrefined and non-repentant depictions of dysfunctional liaisons.

Patrick Swayze offers an unmatched performance, along with James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. Observing this fabulous narrative evolve into a period never forgotten, the matters of affection, fervor, mourning, disgrace, unity, and brutality spring to life. I was initially presented to this series when I was in the eighth standard. As a young lad, you might assume that I wouldn't have been intrigued by this civil war drama. Frankly, this tale captured the hearts of everyone in my class, and this is merely the first volume. I procured the book and analyzed the preferences and disparities and it was marvelous. I am 17 now and still cherish the tale, characters, theme, and recall the episodes of the civil war. As a prospective film director, I also adore North and South: Book One.

text: Among the topmost! As an enthusiast of the civil war, I was thoroughly delighted with the initial installation of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze presents a noteworthy performance, together with James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. In viewing this magnificent saga develop into an era never erased, the themes of romance, zeal, sorrow, embarrassment, peace, and savagery awaken. I was first exposed to this series when I was in grade eight. Being a juvenile boy, one would surmise that I wouldn't have shown interest in this civil war series. Candidly, this narrative seized the hearts of all in my class, and this is only the inaugural book. I purchased the narrative and examined the similarities and variances and it was incredible. I am now 17 and continue to relish the story, characters, topic, and reminisce the times of the civil war. As a future movie maker, I perpetually appreciate North and South: Book One.

Patrick Swayze contributes an exceptional performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down.

To be truthful, this plot won the hearts of all of my classmates, and this is just the first book. I acquired the novel and explored the likes and unlikenesses and it was spectacular. Currently at 17, I persist in enjoying the narrative, characters, subject matter, and recollect the days of the civil war. As a to-be film producer, I will eternally enjoy North and South: Book One.

"I turned this off within the first five minutes.
