"Kabuto is your run-of-the-mill Japanese Steakhouse. Different stations with chefs slinging shrimp tails around the communal dining areas like it's a lunchtime magic show. Always a plethora of laughs and gags going around the group. \n\nThis place is great for lunch. $9 and 30 minutes and you're out the door. Uhhh...If I'm craving a salad with ginger dressing, which I always am, (you do too. admit it) fried rice, steak, shrimp and white sauce (DUDE) then Kabuto is king of lunch options in my book. Always super clean and full of kindhearted staff. The parking lot is super difficult to get in and out of though. 51 traffic at lunch is a beast. Good luck getting stuck behind someone trying to cut across traffic at 12pm on a weekday. It's murder. This place would greatly benefit from another exit/entrance or a stoplight. Here's hoping....\n\nYou can't really shake a stick at balanced lunch when you can have soup or a salad, veggies, fried rice and a choice of a protein for under $10 and be back out the door and headed back to the office or meeting. Glad to see these guys have taken this into account. Though, you should know that the $10 offering mostly comes in the protein department. Some may require more steak or chicken, which can be sparse. \n\nService is always quick and friendly. They do a wonderful job of memorizing orders. Rarely has it come to pass that my order has been mal-delivered. Quick on refills and I love that they always offer a to-go beverage. \""Why, yes! I would love a diet coke to go! How thoughtful!\"" Pretty much always my thought process. \n\nThis place also does full dinner options and has sushi. Neither of which I have tried to date, but would happily oblige if the option was presented. \n\nThanks for the quick and entertaining lunch/service, Kabuto!",2 (3 stars),"Kabuto is your run-of-the-mill Japanese Steakhouse.

The food is always cooked well and the portions are more than enough to fill you up. 

The only downside is that the food can be a bit salty and the white sauce, while delicious, is very heavy. If you're watching your sodium or calorie intake, this might not be the best option for you. But if you're looking for a quick, filling, and affordable lunch, Kabuto is a solid choice.",No

"This is a beautiful theatre with a gorgeous glass front which is great for watching the world go buy while having a coffee.\n\nI have fond memories of coming to this theatre to see the ballet since I was very young.

"We stayed here the night before my girlfriend's flight and didn't really know what to expect.  We were pleasantly surprised that it was a pretty good business hotel!

Wifi was easy to connect to and signal was strong.\n\nBad:  We saw dozens of dogs in this hotel...I know people love their pets, but allowing pets in a hotel without proper fogging is just asking for flea problems, especially since most people let their pets on the bed.  Fortunately, we didn't have any problems with fleas. We DID have a problem with the night staff, though.  The clerk was nice enough, but the second lady (who did the cleaning, I suppose) has a SERIOUS attitude problem.  She was very rude to my Chinese girlfriend, who doesn't always pick up rapid English when it's not spoken directly to her.  We also heard this unpleasant woman tell our neighboring room that \""YOU DO NOT TELL ME TO GET YOU ANYTHING.  YOU TELL THE FRONT DESK AND SHE TELLS ME TO GET THEM.  THAT IS HOW IT WORKS. \""  All in a loud, echoing voice.  \n\nI suppose the breakfast was just OK.  Very light on meat and heavy on cheap carbs, but it was enough to get us out of the door in the morning.  We liked this hotel, but might avoid this particular La Quinta because of that lady.  After hours of driving, we want smiles and not rude barking from a staff member that rivals the dogs that bring fleas into the rooms....\n\nAlso of note:  You can reserve a room with a card, but you must ALSO let them put a hold on your card for the full room amount until checkout.  You can pay cash at checkout.  This wasn't explained to us until we were at the counter.",2 (3 stars),"We stayed here the night before my girlfriend's flight and didn't really know what to expect.

The breakfast was also a bit disappointing. It was just a basic continental breakfast with not much variety.

"With a fun and upbeat bar area, this place is located in downtown Phoenix, close to the US Airways Center. It seemed that the family area was completely separated from the bar area, which I liked. \nThey have plenty of seating but It can get very busy there on a game night. Also, parking can be a problem if you are just there for dinner and drinks. I didn't think of that and ended up paying $10 for parking. \nI ordered the Long Island Iced Tea, it was very potent and tasted great, just the way it the LIIT should taste. My husband got the wings, which I didn't try but he seemed impressed. I got the fish tacos, and they were very good.

"I have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. I won't go back. The first time we were there almost 3 hours. It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers.

The music was really good.\n\nCut to a year later- I spent 6 months planning my sister's bachelorette party in Vegas. We went all out. I decided on Tryst for our last night in Vegas and called a month ahead to reserve a table. The manager said \""no problem\"" and took my name. This was the first time I reserved a table at a bar and didn't have to put down a credit card- weird. Well, I found out why we didn't need a credit card, when 8 of us arrived we passed up the line and were told at the door that they didn't have our reservation. I called the idiot I booked with and he","finally returned my call an hour later mumbling about being sorry. No \""sorry\"" would ever make up for that, I had 8 girls wondering what the hell was going on, plus the night was ruined for my sister- which I can't stand to think about. I can't redo a bachelorette party\n\nThere are a lot of nightclubs to choose from in Vegas! I trusted this place to take care of us, we got f**ked. \n\nNow I am planning my cousins big birthday weekend. Do you think I will suggest Tryst?","said he didn't remember talking to me and that there was nothing he could do.

They were not dirty, but could use a little more attention. 

Overall, I think this place has potential, but needs to figure out what it wants to be. The food was good, but not great. The prices were a bit high for what you get. I would probably give it another try, but I'm not in a rush to go back.",No
"I SO want to give this place 5 stars.  Friendly, delicious and great prices.  \n\nBut...I just can't do 5 stars for a vegan restaurant where the employees hang out outside smoking.  Because now when I order buffalo hummus or yummy grape leave dolmas, I can't help but wonder if the employee just lit up on her break, and grabbed my tahini with nicotine-stained-smokey fingers.  Yuk.  Smoking + cooking?  It's a deal-breaker. Smoking + cooking at a vegan restaurant? Seems like an SNL skit.",3 (4 stars),"I SO want to give this place 5 stars.

"ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!!!\n\nHygiene,  hygiene,  hygiene! \n\nI'm writing about the horrific hygiene at this place.   One of the servers was putting on her lipstick and lip liner at the hostess/check in station,  handles plates and silverware.  \n\nI'm walking to our table I see another lady sneeze into her hands with both hands cupped.  Didnt wash her hands, just started fixing her her eyeliner with her finger tips.

I was literally sick to my stomach. \n\nI asked to see the manager, and about 10 minutes of waiting told him the deplorable practices I observed, and left.

"This place gets crazy packed and the lines are ridiculous! its out the door and when you finally get inside the door there is another line waiting!
