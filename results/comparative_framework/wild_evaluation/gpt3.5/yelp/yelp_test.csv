"Kabuto is your run-of-the-mill Japanese Steakhouse. Different stations with chefs slinging shrimp tails around the communal dining areas like it's a lunchtime magic show. Always a plethora of laughs and gags going around the group. \n\nThis place is great for lunch. $9 and 30 minutes and you're out the door. Uhhh...If I'm craving a salad with ginger dressing, which I always am, (you do too. admit it) fried rice, steak, shrimp and white sauce (DUDE) then Kabuto is king of lunch options in my book. Always super clean and full of kindhearted staff. The parking lot is super difficult to get in and out of though. 51 traffic at lunch is a beast. Good luck getting stuck behind someone trying to cut across traffic at 12pm on a weekday. It's murder. This place would greatly benefit from another exit/entrance or a stoplight. Here's hoping....\n\nYou can't really shake a stick at balanced lunch when you can have soup or a salad, veggies, fried rice and a choice of a protein for under $10 and be back out the door and headed back to the office or meeting. Glad to see these guys have taken this into account. Though, you should know that the $10 offering mostly comes in the protein department. Some may require more steak or chicken, which can be sparse. \n\nService is always quick and friendly. They do a wonderful job of memorizing orders. Rarely has it come to pass that my order has been mal-delivered. Quick on refills and I love that they always offer a to-go beverage. \""Why, yes! I would love a diet coke to go! How thoughtful!\"" Pretty much always my thought process. \n\nThis place also does full dinner options and has sushi. Neither of which I have tried to date, but would happily oblige if the option was presented. \n\nThanks for the quick and entertaining lunch/service, Kabuto!",2 (3 stars),"Kabuto is your run-of-the-mill Japanese Steakhouse.

The food is decent, nothing extraordinary, but it's a good option for a quick and affordable lunch. The chefs at the different stations are entertaining and add some fun to the dining experience. The communal dining areas can get a bit crowded, especially during peak lunch hours, but the atmosphere is lively and there's always a lot of laughter and jokes going around. 

I particularly enjoy their salad with ginger dressing, it's always fresh and flavorful. The fried rice is tasty and the steak and shrimp are cooked to perfection. The white sauce is a must-try, it adds a creamy and tangy flavor to the dishes. 

The staff at Kabuto is friendly and attentive, making sure that you have everything you need. The restaurant is always clean and well-maintained. However, the parking situation can be a hassle. The parking lot is small and it can be difficult to find a spot, especially during busy lunch hours. The traffic on 51 can also be a challenge, so be prepared for some delays if you're driving during peak hours. 

Overall, Kabuto is a solid choice for a quick and affordable lunch. The food is satisfying and the atmosphere is fun. It would be great if they could improve the parking situation and maybe add another entrance or a stoplight to make it easier to get in and out. But despite these minor inconveniences, I would still recommend Kabuto for a tasty and enjoyable lunch option.",No

They have a slight hint of corn flavor that adds an extra layer of deliciousness to any dish. Whether you're ordering tacos, burritos, or enchiladas, these tortillas will take your meal to the next level. The fillings and toppings are also top-notch, with generous portions and fresh ingredients. The flavors are bold and authentic, making each bite a true delight. The service is friendly and efficient, ensuring a pleasant dining experience. I highly recommend trying their carne asada tacos - the meat is tender and flavorful, perfectly complemented by the tortillas. Overall, this place is a must-visit for any Mexican food lover.",No
"We stayed here the night before my girlfriend's flight and didn't really know what to expect.  We were pleasantly surprised that it was a pretty good business hotel!

The clerk was nice enough, but the second lady (who did the cleaning, I suppose) has a SERIOUS attitude problem.

This place is clean and the staff was friendly. Very patient as we decided on what to order. I'm a huge fan of chow fun (fried thick rice noodles) so I went ahead and order that. My friend order sweet and sour chicken. Our food came out and timely manner. My noodles were very tough are hard to chew.  Which is not good start. They're suppose to be soft. Ugh I never had a bad chow fun. But I will go back and try it again. Might be their first day so well see. Beside that it was good. My friend like the sweet and sour chicken but he didn't like how it was prepared. They serve it with the sauce on the side. He preferred it came already sauced up. The price was great about $10 and under. They had a few dishes that were $10 and above. They also do lunch specials until 4pm. I will definitely try it again.,2 (3 stars),I was so excited to try this place out. I came here for dinner and it was grand opening.

"I have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. I won't go back. The first time we were there almost 3 hours. It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food.

The staff is friendly enough, but they don't seem very knowledgeable about the items they have for sale. I asked a few questions about a particular piece of furniture and they couldn't provide any information beyond what was written on the price tag. It's disappointing when you're hoping to learn more about the history or origin of an item and the staff can't offer any insight. 

The overall atmosphere of Sleep Poet Antique Mall is a bit chaotic. There are so many different items crammed into the space that it can feel overwhelming. It's also quite dusty and cluttered, which takes away from the charm of browsing through antique treasures. I found it difficult to focus on any one item because there was just too much to look at. 

In terms of pricing, I agree with the previous reviewer that most of the items seem overpriced. I understand that antiques can be valuable, but it's disheartening to see such high price tags on items that are in less-than-perfect condition. I was hoping to find some unique and affordable pieces, but I left empty-handed.

"I've had a variety of experiences with Green Cab, ranging from average to terrible. \n\nTonight, a Friday night, I called a cab at 9:50pm to take me from one end of downtown to the other. Yes, a decently busy time to call, but nothing out of the ordinary. Although I'm willing to wait 15-25 minutes on a Friday night, I'm not willing to wait 50 minutes. By that point, your energy is exhausted from the frustration of waiting. \n\nIn general, Green Cab kind of blows. Yes, they have eco-friendly cars and sweet ipads, but that's really not what I want in a cab service. I'd rather have a short wait time or a reliable estimate if it's a busy period. With Green Cab, there's really no telling when they'll arrive. \n\nI've also had trouble paying on several occasions. Some of the drivers enjoying pulling the old \""my machine is broken\"" when you try to pay with credit cards, while others claim not to have any change for your $20. You're a cab driver. Your only responsibility is to drive, accept credit cards, and be able to make change. If you're missing 2 of those 3, you're doin' it wrong. \n\nAlso, if you're waiting for Green Cab and want to see where your cab is, forget it. Rather than placing your call on a hold line, Green Cab routes calls to a busy signal, so you're SOL in terms of following up when it's busy. \n\nOther than that, Green Cab is awesome. \n\nAll in all, I'd stick with Union Cab. You *might* pay more, but it's worth it. Plus, the drivers are way cooler. One even had Cash Cab-style questions ready to ask me at 3am. But maybe you're not into Cash Cab.

It's frustrating and unprofessional when drivers make excuses or inconvenience customers with payment issues.

Furthermore, the quality of the rides themselves can be hit or miss. Some drivers are friendly and take the most direct routes, while others seem to take longer routes to increase the fare. This inconsistency in service makes it difficult to trust Green Cab as a reliable option.

Overall, my experiences with Green Cab have been disappointing. From long wait times to payment problems and inconsistent service, I cannot recommend them. There are plenty of other cab services in the area that provide better customer service and reliability.",No

"I think this place has a bit of an identity crisis. It's either a fast casual restaurant or its a sit down restaurant.
