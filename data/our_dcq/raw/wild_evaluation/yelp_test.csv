"Kabuto is your run-of-the-mill Japanese Steakhouse. Different stations with chefs slinging shrimp tails around the communal dining areas like it's a lunchtime magic show. Always a plethora of laughs and gags going around the group. \n\nThis place is great for lunch. $9 and 30 minutes and you're out the door. Uhhh...If I'm craving a salad with ginger dressing, which I always am, (you do too. admit it) fried rice, steak, shrimp and white sauce (DUDE) then Kabuto is king of lunch options in my book. Always super clean and full of kindhearted staff. The parking lot is super difficult to get in and out of though. 51 traffic at lunch is a beast. Good luck getting stuck behind someone trying to cut across traffic at 12pm on a weekday. It's murder. This place would greatly benefit from another exit/entrance or a stoplight. Here's hoping....\n\nYou can't really shake a stick at balanced lunch when you can have soup or a salad, veggies, fried rice and a choice of a protein for under $10 and be back out the door and headed back to the office or meeting. Glad to see these guys have taken this into account. Though, you should know that the $10 offering mostly comes in the protein department. Some may require more steak or chicken, which can be sparse. \n\nService is always quick and friendly. They do a wonderful job of memorizing orders. Rarely has it come to pass that my order has been mal-delivered. Quick on refills and I love that they always offer a to-go beverage. \""Why, yes! I would love a diet coke to go! How thoughtful!\"" Pretty much always my thought process. \n\nThis place also does full dinner options and has sushi. Neither of which I have tried to date, but would happily oblige if the option was presented. \n\nThanks for the quick and entertaining lunch/service, Kabuto!",2 (3 stars)

"This is a beautiful theatre with a gorgeous glass front which is great for watching the world go buy while having a coffee.\n\nI have fond memories of coming to this theatre to see the ballet since I was very young. I rather distinctly remember on my 9th birthday vomiting on the stairs during a performance of Cinderella. Ahh memories.\n\nBut this theatre really is lovely. Its the sort of theatre that you get a little dressed up to go to, like people used to do back in the day. I was lucky enough to see a stunning performance of the Nutcracker here in January, which obviously is mostly attributed to Scottish Ballet but the theatre played a huge role also. Everything from the sound to the lighting was fantastic and it really was a magical evening. \n\nThere is a number of bars for you to have a quick tipple during the interval, but you have to be quick out your seat because it gets very busy fast. \n\nTickets can be expensive, but it really attracts some of the better quality shows so it is worth it and it really makes for a nice evening out.",4 (5 stars)

"Holy cow, their food is outstanding, but their tortillas are the best in PHX, home of the best Mexican food in the US...that is saying a lot, I know, but please check them out for yourself. I'm going back to PHX soon for the first time since moving away, and Carolina's will be my first stop. I'm salivating just writing this review. Truly awesome!!!",4 (5 stars)
"We stayed here the night before my girlfriend's flight and didn't really know what to expect.  We were pleasantly surprised that it was a pretty good business hotel!  I'll list the good and bad separately.\n\nGood:  The sheets were clean, the room was clean, the water was hot, the amenities were good for the price point and the beds were fairly comfortable.  Wifi was easy to connect to and signal was strong.\n\nBad:  We saw dozens of dogs in this hotel...I know people love their pets, but allowing pets in a hotel without proper fogging is just asking for flea problems, especially since most people let their pets on the bed.  Fortunately, we didn't have any problems with fleas. We DID have a problem with the night staff, though.  The clerk was nice enough, but the second lady (who did the cleaning, I suppose) has a SERIOUS attitude problem.  She was very rude to my Chinese girlfriend, who doesn't always pick up rapid English when it's not spoken directly to her.  We also heard this unpleasant woman tell our neighboring room that \""YOU DO NOT TELL ME TO GET YOU ANYTHING.  YOU TELL THE FRONT DESK AND SHE TELLS ME TO GET THEM.  THAT IS HOW IT WORKS. \""  All in a loud, echoing voice.  \n\nI suppose the breakfast was just OK.  Very light on meat and heavy on cheap carbs, but it was enough to get us out of the door in the morning.  We liked this hotel, but might avoid this particular La Quinta because of that lady.  After hours of driving, we want smiles and not rude barking from a staff member that rivals the dogs that bring fleas into the rooms....\n\nAlso of note:  You can reserve a room with a card, but you must ALSO let them put a hold on your card for the full room amount until checkout.  You can pay cash at checkout.  This wasn't explained to us until we were at the counter.",2 (3 stars)
"Stopped back by Mellow Mushroom with my mate Justin from Brew Bros. & a few of our mates Monday afternoon while pub crawling on a day off.  \nFirst I must say my return trip was motivated by an immediate response from to my 1st Yelp review from Mellow Mushroom's owner Jay.  I didnt expect any reponse, much less a return so quickly. Respect for that. Great to see to someone paying such close attention to their customers.\nThis can only be a good thing.\nThe same draft selection as the first time around.  48 Handles.  Thats a lot of beer.  As said in my first reiview, with 48 handles I would Love to see more variety and a bit more imagination with respect to the draft beer choices, then again who would complain about a selection w/ at least 40 craft beers on tap?   Thats a real commitment. \nOur bartender Madison was enthusiastic about what she was serving which in Arizona's growing craft beer community is a big plus.  On a another note, this time around the food I ordered made it out of the kitchen rather quickly.  Just a mediterainan salad, but nice.\nAll said, great to see another craft beer brother join the club.  Nice to have you here.",3 (4 stars)
Went for lunch to celebrate a grinding training finally ending. Burgers and drinks were good. I wish I had time to sit there and savor it. \n\nI will go again with kids which is the true test as we all know.,2 (3 stars)
The drunken noodles..... Get them now. \n\nThe restaurant owner is very nice and you can tell he loves what he does. Now don't let the layout throw you. It may not be the fanciest but the noodles are goooood. We ll be back. \n\nPrice 3.5/5 average \nAtmosphere 3/5 \nFood 5/5,3 (4 stars)
"They look full so I decided to give it a try.  People standing at a Panda Express set up line, order in a foreign language, so it is usually a good sign, that the food is authentic.  But when we order the sweet and sour pork, the lady behind the glass give us All fat pork.  A minute ago, I saw she spooned all lean pork from the same dish to a lady who obviously speak their language.  So that is a big turn-off, I am not coming back again.",0 (1 star)
"Visit was Friday, July 3rd around 5pm.  Tables were very sticky. All of them. Wanted inside and stuck us in an irritating spot next to a white cloth covering crates beneath a TV. Sangria was sour and not fruity. Paper towel dispenser was broken in restroom and area was very dirty.  Didn't have the corned beef and cabbage for \""signature\"" soup! NO Corned beef and cabbage in an Irish restaurant!!!  The tomatoes on the bruschetta tasted moldy.  The clam chowder soup was too salty.  The soda bread  was tasteless and dry.  Shepherd's pie was too hot (definitely microwaved) and kind of bland although the meat was like chef boyardee.  Also, the decor was bad, everything they had hung was wrinkled. You can tell they don't really care. Waitress was ok. This place needs new management or someone from corporate to come here and see how terrible this place really is.  Will never return again, ever.",0 (1 star)
"Secret gem hidden in a residential neighborhood. Interior is clean and inviting. Seating is pretty limited so expect to wait if you arrive during peak hours. Great Steak & Eggs or Steak sandwhich for $5.99, but it doesn't taste like it was $5.99. Service is always tops and you know a place is good when servers know customers by name. My parents love this place so much they sometimes go 5 plus times a week. Nothing on the menu is breathtaking just your normal family restaurant food. Great prices, fantastic specials, and consistently good services. In a town like Vegas you can't beat that.",3 (4 stars)
"Not much to say. Very typical type of spot. Nice look and feel. Decent food. Didnt blow me away, but maybe that is because I didnt try their famous pizza. \n\nI'll update the next time I am out there, but that is only if I actually feel like going back. I recommend it more as a spot to fit a bunch of friends who want to grab some cold ones and some grub while watching the games.",2 (3 stars)
"Jupiter's is a fun place for families with younger kids, but it's not anything special for adults.  The food isn't spectacular, and the pizza is similar to Monical's thin crust pizza if you're curious what to expect.  There's a BIG arcade room with pool tables and video games, but this area gets PACKED if you go at a popular time of day.  I've only been to Jupiter's once, and I haven't really had the desire to go back.  The service was ok, but the atmosphere and food weren't anything special.  We also had a LONG wait to get a table and food.",2 (3 stars)
"Cirque du Soleil prices without the Cirque du Soleil talent.  I kept waiting to be amazed by people doing things with their bodies that I can't do.  That's why I pay you the big bucks, people!  The costumes and music (of course) are fantastic, though.",1 (2 stars)
"Enough variety for me. Only reason I go to buffet - Shrimp, Oysters, Sushi and Salmon. They had all of these, so I'm happy. If you are looking for a quality buffet, skip this one . It didn't look clean and I had my waitress sit on our side table facing us while we eat. Annoyed, but I don't care much. Total bill without drinks, with tax - $22.64. \n\nI will come back here again over Lin's. I won't bring guests here though!",3 (4 stars)
"If you're going long distances, use the Deuce (i.e. from the Strip to Downtown). Otherwise, it's a waste of time and you'd be better off calling a taxi.\n\nFirst, this thing moves incredibly slow, and I have no idea why. When I first took it, it was during heavy traffic, so I made excuses for the bus driver. But the next time, there was no traffic anywhere, and we still went the same speed.\n\nThe whole double decker set up is annoying. Many people carry bags or luggage and carrying them up and down those stairs takes a lot of effort. Plus, if the bus is crowded (which it usually is), you have to fight to get around everyone else. I can see how having the double decker might be thought of as a fun way to see the Strip, but the whole bus is covered in ads, so you're not getting a very good view.\n\nFinally, I didn't really like the way I was treated when I was trying to board. There was an employee at the bus stop that was instructing people how to get on the bus (is that normal?). He asked if I had a pass or something, and when I said I did not, he told me I couldn't get on! I had two dollars, so I wasn't sure what the problems was. He got slightly indignant and told me I could only board if I had exact change. Which I did.\n\nI can see how a lot of tourists are idiots and that guy probably does need to be there, but it pissed me off. I could read all the signs plastered all over the bus stop, not to mention all over the bus.",1 (2 stars)
"Mary Coyle is some pretty good ice cream. i would write a longer review, but the history has been covered, and the atmosphere. \n\ni would like this place more, but purchasing ice cream to go afew times i have noticed i need to let it thaw for a month before i can actually eat it. it's frozen that hard. other then that this place is pretty cool. :P",2 (3 stars)
I was so excited to try this place out. I came here for dinner and it was grand opening. When we enter the staff was just sitting and one of them got up to assist up.  This place is clean and the staff was friendly. Very patient as we decided on what to order. I'm a huge fan of chow fun (fried thick rice noodles) so I went ahead and order that. My friend order sweet and sour chicken. Our food came out and timely manner. My noodles were very tough are hard to chew.  Which is not good start. They're suppose to be soft. Ugh I never had a bad chow fun. But I will go back and try it again. Might be their first day so well see. Beside that it was good. My friend like the sweet and sour chicken but he didn't like how it was prepared. They serve it with the sauce on the side. He preferred it came already sauced up. The price was great about $10 and under. They had a few dishes that were $10 and above. They also do lunch specials until 4pm. I will definitely try it again.,2 (3 stars)
"Woodmans is the grocery store of the damned.  The produce is attrocious and nasty.  The lines are always way too long.  It seems dirty.  Its unpleasant in so many ways.  It takes forever to shop there.  Its cheap, but I'd rather pay a few extra cents for a more pleasant grocery store.",1 (2 stars)
"This place is not bad but not that best place I've ever been.  We had stone crab claws and stuffed shrimp for apps, for dinner I had Chilean Sea Bass with pan fried corn. Apps were great and dinner was pretty good too. The bass was not the best piece of sea bass I've ever had but it wasn't the worse either. Now, that corn was crazy bananas good. If you don't get anything else, get the corn.",2 (3 stars)
"With a fun and upbeat bar area, this place is located in downtown Phoenix, close to the US Airways Center. It seemed that the family area was completely separated from the bar area, which I liked. \nThey have plenty of seating but It can get very busy there on a game night. Also, parking can be a problem if you are just there for dinner and drinks. I didn't think of that and ended up paying $10 for parking. \nI ordered the Long Island Iced Tea, it was very potent and tasted great, just the way it the LIIT should taste. My husband got the wings, which I didn't try but he seemed impressed. I got the fish tacos, and they were very good. The cilantro sauce that came with it was  a little thick and tasted more like ranch, but the salsa was ok. \nAll in all, I had a great time there and the bartenders were all very friendly and attentive.",3 (4 stars)
"This was my first buffet I've been since being away from Vegas for years. And this wasn't my best decision. \n\nMy boys and I were wanted to grab a meal at a buffet before our night out in the city of sin.  Apparently, this was the closest one and had a short line. Once we got to cashier, I was in shock to hear how much an individual had to pay for buffet dinner. For the price for an individual had to pay, we could've got the 24 hour buffet pass. More buffets to visit at different hotels.\n\nOnce we paid, we waited a couple minutes for our table.  After our table was ready and then seated, our server took our drink orders. When everything was settled at the table, we were off to explore the buffet's offerings.\n\nThe selections were very limited since some stations were left unreplenished. With what was available, I had to make my $47 dinner worth it. I went for the grilled meats: kobe beef & prime rib, short rib tacos, assortments of sushi & sashimi, and beef Wellington. For dessert, I got mini churros and vending machine ice cream.\n\nThe pros:\n- Short rib tacos\n- Shasimi & sushi\n\nThe cons:\n- Grilled meats were very dry, also the beef Wellington\n- Mini churros were hard and stale\n- Ice cream from the vending machine taste like any other buffet place back home\n\nOur server was helpful but got all our drink orders wrong. I left full, dissaponinted, and unsatisfied.",1 (2 stars)
"What do you do when Coca is packed? Well, sadly, the answer for us didn't lie at Mauramori, as much as we've tried over the past year. \n\nThe food here is fine, but that's really it. It's a touch above what you would expect at a run-of-the-mill diner, but nothing more. \n\nThe coffee is probably Green Mountain or whatever bulk option you'd expect to have somewhere that doesn't care too much about it. There are no fresh juices or other creative beverage options that can enhance your breakfast.\n\nThe deal breaker for us was the apathetic speed of service. The servers are friendly, it just seems like they have no urgency to do anything. Our food routinely came out 10 minutes later than expect all while the place wasn't even full.",1 (2 stars)

"Service has always been great, don't care for the dry bread but it's the horrible water that stands out as trying to get the customer to order a \""drink\"". Out of the four of us at dinner we all agreed the water tasted like chlorine water from someone's pool. The server said it's \""filtered\"". NOT a chance! We asked him if we could get the water from bartender. He replied \""it's the same\"". He kept pushing ordering a $4 sparkling water or cocktail etc. We all agreed no thanks. I went up to the bar later and asked for a glass of water. What do you know? It was fine and definitely filtered. Food is alright but when the water tastes better at even In and Out or any other restaurant you know they aren't paying attention to detail.

"I am a frequent customer of this establishment and I appreciate the quality of their beer and the consistency of good service in the bar area. I have only dined in the main seating area twice, and one time it resulted in a beer bath for my wife and infant son but hey, que sera sera right? My overall experience with GB has been positive. Food is good quality but overpriced in my opinion. I tend to take advantage of their happy hour specials if possible. I have had a couple snafus regarding my order, one in particular where my dinner salad came after the entree, but they comped the salad and apologized, no big deal. My go to brew is the hefeweizen, you will not be disappointed with its banana-clovey smoothness. Cheers!",3 (4 stars)

The instructor was nice, cautious, knowledgeable, and gave me a few minutes of instructions on how to shoot each. They also let you choose your target.

They are the biggest and one of the better looking among the modest restaurants in Terminal 4 B gates. The big pig on the wall with the retro typeface tries to subvert the overwhelming and inescapable airport food court vibe.\n\n\nThe waitress was friendly and the service was prompt.\n\nI ordered a grilled cheese with tomato soup. The cheese was just tasteless and the soup was more salty than if it had come out of a can. I asked for coffee to go and it was barely lukewarm - made me think if the service was really as genuine as you can expect at an airport eatery.\n\nI will remember this place enough to not go there the next time I fly to Vegas through that airport.,0 (1 star)
"Burger Bar is just ok. The veggie burger option isn't tasty. I'd much prefer a Boca Burger over Burger Bar's version. The menu describe the veggie burger as \"" This burger will flirt with your taste buds and delight your palate with its intriguing combination of whole grains, brown rice, onions, soy, cheese, mushroom, garlic and special spices.\"" Um, no. More like mushy rice mess that sends my taste buds packing. \n\nThe sweet potato fries are delicious. One of the people in our party ordered the kobe beef/foie gras burger (aka Rossini), which was just ok. I seriously doubt it was worth the $60 price tag, but it came with a free dessert. We chose the chocolate burger, which is a warm donut (as the bun) with chocolate ganache as the meat patty and a slice of jellied passionfruit as a cheese slice. This was awesome. I would come back JUST for the dessert burgers.",2 (3 stars)
"I've been coming to the restaurant regularly for the past week. The food is delicious, definitely recommend Kao Mun Kai Tod. The food deserves a better review but it is the horrible customer service that made me give this restaurant a one star.\n\nI came in for lunch and it was very busy, so I decided to wave at the waiter and said \""excuse me\"". The man with attitude came up to me mocking my waving gesture and said \""I can see you and you don't have to do that\"". This is the first time in my life I've ever seen a waiter getting offended because a customer tried getting their attention by waving and saying excuse me. As a customer I must say I was truly offended, Mr. Attitude came to pick up the menus after we have ordered our food. As a concerned customer I reminded him that his job was a waiter and that's not the attitude he should have. \n\nAfter speaking to a lady who appears to be the manager, she told me something along the line that \""waving to a waiter is unacceptable in Britain and this is not how it works around here\"". I then apologized to her for losing my temper at their employee and came to a conclusion that customer service is non existence in this particular restaurant. It's a shame. Really.",0 (1 star)

"Not sure why it's called a cantina. The bar had 8 different tequilas. I asked the Bartender why they didn't have the shelves stocked and her reply was they were cutting back on tequila?????\nI ordered a burger that was advertised as a 1/2 pound burger. I ordered it and to be cooked medium rare.\nWell, when the burger was delivered the patty of mystery meat appeared to have been 1/4 lb at best before cooking, surely not a 1/2 lb burger and it was cooked well done. This was our 2nd time dining and it will be our last. From the looks of the selection on the shelves and the fact that we were the only one's there for lunch they appear to be another doomed restaurant. excuse me Cantina",0 (1 star)

"Thai is one of my favorite cuisines - it has a unique and delicate balance of spice with flavor. Siam Thai just nails it with its signature Pad Thai. It's one of the best Pad Thais I've ever had. I'd also recommend  the Iced Thai Tea, as it's is a great accompaniment to the meal. The Panang Curry is also good, though, not the best.\n\nThe restaurant isn't exactly in the most \""happening\"" places of Glendale, but the decor is tastefully done - distinctive elephant shaped chairs, for example, complete with Thai music. \n\nThe service was good and prompt., and can be even better if they have more waiters. \n\nIn summary, if you like Thai, you'll love Siam Thai!",3 (4 stars)
"I have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. I won't go back. The first time we were there almost 3 hours. It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers. I'll pass on this place if my family decides to go again. Not worth it at all with all the other good Italian options around.",0 (1 star)

The atmosphere and ambience here is unbelievable. Elegant and classy with a distinctive southwestern look and feel.I started off with French Onion soup. Great flavor and aroma.  I had the porterhouse. A good cut that was seasoned and cooked to a perfect medium rare. A nice side of mixed sauces accompanied the steak.The fries I ordered were the only weak point of the meal. I expected hand cut steak fries and got what seemed to be overdone frozen Ore-Ida shoestring fries. Oh the house bread was killer. Individually baked buttery brioche loaves with a touch of sea salt on to. I was stuffed and passed on dessert but the cappuccino was top notch. Servers friendly and on point from start to finish.,3 (4 stars)
"Met some friends here for drinks at the bar, which is shockingly small and not suited for groups larger than 4. The house wines are excellent. I got the lemon artichoke hearts - which were awful, and overpriced. The bread crumbs were drenched in butter and had a greasy feel to them, and the lemon was overpowering. The piano player didn't know any of the songs my friends or I requested - and we weren't making ridiculous requests - what piano player doesn't know Irving Berlin? \n\nIt's a great place to sit and talk and drink wine, AFTER you've eaten somewhere else.",2 (3 stars)
"One of THEE best places to eat in Madison, for sure. It can be a bit loud inside, but who cares. The food and drinks are so delicious. The upstairs bar is very quaint and spacious. Support this bar, it is SO worth it!",4 (5 stars)
"The food was alright and I thought that the portions were a good size. But i think that the service was absolutely terrible. My friend and I walked in and two women at the counter ignored us for a couple minutes, said they would be with us in a second, continued to ignore us until we finally asked if we could just seat ourselves and they just said yes. We then sat ourselves - and waited for about 15 minutes before someone came up and asked if we were going to be eating there. From then on out - the service still was not very good and everything took a long time. The waitress wouldn't even look at us when we were ordering - as if she just did not care. The food definitely does not make up for the terrible service. I will not eat there again.",1 (2 stars)
"Dr. Savitsky and her staff are simply amazing.

"Wow. Now I remember why I never cared much for Butterfield's. We had a good experience about a month ago, motivating us to return. Today, our experience could best be described as stressful.\n\nWe checked in early on a Sunday, largely beating the rush. As a party of six, however, we still had a 25 minute wait. Not bad. A half hour came and went, so we checked to see how much longer it would be. They indicated we had already been seated. Quite a surprise to us as you can imagine. \n\nWe were promised we would be next. Another 25 minutes came and went. Another large party was seated. Then, finally, us. Without apology. \n\nService was adequate. The specialty pancakes were fine, but two omelets we ordered were quite disappointing. \n\nA simple genuine apology for the seating screw up would have gone a long way. Or at least then serve us something exceptional.  Treating customers so poorly, whether a result of complacency or arrogance, is how seemingly invincible restaurants like Butterfield's find a path to failure.",1 (2 stars)

We came for dessert.  The kids liked their sundae and shake.  They were not very tasty to me...the chocolate shake had a strange cinnamon after taste.  My German chocolate cake just made me sad.  Blech.  The server was very nice.  But I won't be back.,1 (2 stars)
Where is Eddie or Eddy????? I will not come here any longer if Eddie is not available. To the point a rude service. Technician never looked me in the eye and was turned away from me joking and yakking it up with her colleagues. \nThe place looked like a bomb went off. \nI have been getting decent to good service till now. But this will be the end if Eddy is not available.\nAlso: everyone of the technicians picks up or checks their personal phone.... While working on your feet or hands.,0 (1 star)
"It's sad that once I logged on to leave a review I see the 5 star review I left one year ago for this place. It used to be my favorite until Saturday night. We went for dinner after drinking downtown around 7pm and was told there was a 30min wait and we'll receive a text once our table was ready. We go to a bar to waste time and 45mins later we receive a text so we return. Once we are seated a woman who said she was part owner tells us that the restaurant is \""very busy tonight and you'll need to be done within a hour\"" and she continues to tell us about the table of 14 that's eating and it being a small kitchen. Mind you they weren't slammed. Our waiter takes our order (still no drinks) and it took so long that we had to ask him after 45 mins where it was. We're now sarcastically thinking, \""Well does the hour start now since we received our food or what?\"" We then ask to speak to the manager about the lack of service and the lady comes back over!!! Ugh! We tell her about our experience and remind her of how rude she was to us and she says there's no way she can compensate us in any way. Smh. What's really bad about it is we're locals so when the tourists aren't there who does she think Le Thai is serving?",0 (1 star)
"I had lunch here Thursday. I have eaten here before and loved it but this time, not sure I would go back. The waitress came over to take our order and when I said I was going to order a salad but looked down at the menu she quickly said she had another table and would come back. Off she went. We had our water glasses refilled. The gal filled one glass over the top of one of our handbags, a Prada. She didn't seem to care and almost apologized as she casually went to get at towel but didn't hand us one. We cleaned up the water on the outside and inside of the handbag with our napkins. After searching for and flagging down the waitress to order our lunch, I ordered the mixed greens salad with turkey. The salad was ok but the turkey appeared to be packaged sliced lunch meat chopped into squares. It was awful. The bread on the salad was extremely tough and chewy. As we were eating, we watched, who I think was the manager, clean the lights over the bar as people sat there eating their lunch. The dust was flying everywhere and also landed on the bar. From our table we could see the dust because the bar was higher.  She didn't wipe the bar off but rather went around and began inspecting the clean glasses. One man was sitting there with his lunch and a glass of water. She cleaned the light next to him anyway. There also seemed to be something going on between two of the gals in the dining area. Not impressed this time around.",1 (2 stars)

"The food wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either.

This place was soo much fun. The food was delicious. Bobby the singer was wonderful and made my girlfriends night. Definitely will come back,4 (5 stars)
"The fried chicken and sides are pretty good, however the overall wait time subtracts from my star rating.  I've visited this location twice since it has opened and the wait time really isn't worth it.  My first visit resulted in about a 1.5 hour wait and the order was incorrect, so the final wait time was close to 2 hours.  My second visit on 08/19/12 was approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes.  During the second visit on a Sunday there was only one register open and nearly 100 people in line.\n\nThis is a good place to grab dinner after winding down a long shopping trip, but it's not somewhere that you can run to and pick up a quick bite.  Since Popeye's is considered fast food and not Gordon Ramsey's steak in Las Vegas, I have to give it a low rating, because \""who would wait over an hour in line at a McDonalds or Burger King?\"".\n\nI'll give the place 6-8 months for the hype to calm down and then I'll return and update my review.",1 (2 stars)
"I had a pretty good time at this place soon after it opened.  The music was really good.\n\nCut to a year later- I spent 6 months planning my sister's bachelorette party in Vegas.  We went all out.  I decided on Tryst for our last night in Vegas and called a month ahead to reserve a table.  The manager said \""no problem\"" and took my name.  This was the first time I reserved a table at a bar and didn't have to put down a credit card- weird.  Well, I found out why we didn't need a credit card, when 8 of us arrived we passed up the line and were told at the door that they didn't have our reservation.  I called the idiot I booked with and he finally returned my call an hour later mumbling about being sorry.  No \""sorry\"" would ever make up for that, I had 8 girls wondering what the hell was going on, plus the night was ruined for my sister- which I can't stand to think about.  I can't redo a bachelorette party\n\nThere are a lot of nightclubs to choose from in Vegas!  I trusted this place to take care of us, we got f**ked. \n\nNow I am planning my cousins big birthday weekend.  Do you think I will suggest Tryst?",0 (1 star)
"I don't got to school at UNCC but discovered the gardens because I was looking for something outdoorsy, safe, and active to do while I was visiting the area for work and looking for some true beauty in the middle of stripmall-landia.  What a find and worth the effort to find and take the time to relax and enjoy the beauty of a simple walk on a hidden path in a busy campus!\n\nAlthough many plants are not in season (I visited in January, many plants were in hibernation), the botanical gardens, per my interpretation, are designed as series of walking paths that capture natures essence from various perspectives.  The effect is calming, relaxing, and purifying, regardless if you're a traveler searching out something different, or a student seeking solace, refuge, or even just a moment of calm in the midst of a hectic class schedule.",3 (4 stars)
"Everything you need is here.\n\nWe stayed here on a stagette because the bride has seen \""The Hangover\"" way too many times. Actually, I never asked her why this hotel... but she insisted that we stay here. I am glad she did because it seriously has everything you want... It's smoking hot in August (duh) so being somewhere with a decent nightclub, a bunch of restaurants, shopping, a beautiful pool, a convenience store... seriously, if need be, I wouldn't have had to venture outside.\n\nWe had booked a room in the Forum Tower. When we arrived, they upgraded us to the Palace Tower. Woot woot. Much bigger room with two washrooms. Perfect for three girls. If we were on a higher floor, we would have had a view of the pool. I think I saw the top of Snackus Maximus. I wish we had a fridge for our use since ours was filled to the brim with mini-bar regulars. But we had ice... after getting vodka and mixers from the store in the lobby, we were able to imbibe in the room. \n\nWe spent a lot of time in the room since we spent a lot of time in the hotel. It was just so easy to pop upstairs to grab something or to drop off our shopping before coming back down to play the Big Buck Hunter slots. We wandered to Spago's in the Forum Shops before dancing the night away at Pure. \n\nUtter convenience.",3 (4 stars)

"Sleep Poet Antique Mall is big, and they have a lot of different kind of things.  However, the great items and great bargains appear to be few and far between, which is a huge turn-off for me.  Overall, I give it about a 2.5.\n\nYou could spend probably hours here looking at all their wares.  They offer a wide selection of items, from jewelry, furniture, clothes, decorations, records, books, dishes, and other random kitchen items (and much, much more).  The place is filled with little \""booths,\"" which I am assuming is either an attempt to group types of items together or are all owned by one person/business.  It's fairly easy to navigate your way around the store from booth to booth.\n\nOn the weekends, this place is crazy.  People are packed in here, and parking becomes quite difficult.  It is also difficult to find reasonably-priced, good items here.  Because the store is so large, it's quite time-consuming to take the time to find a good bargain.  Most of the wares they offer seem overpriced, with many of them in serious disrepair.  Just because it's \""old\"" does not always mean it's an antique.  \n\nI would probably go check it out again, but definitely not on a weekend.  I am not a fan of large crowds, and this place can definitely get very crowded.  That being said, this a great place for people who long for a good bargain hunt.  If you don't mind a bit of a crowd, and you are the sort of person who loves to wade through things for an awesome bargain, this is probably the place for you.  I'm definitely sad that I am far too impatient for this type of place, because I've seen people walk away with some nice stuff.",1 (2 stars)

"To your left you'll see a rock that looks like a dinosaur and to your right you'll see a rock that looks like a person.  Sometimes you'll see some real animals, but not today...  \n\nReally? Is that all you've got.  Maybe we just didn't luck out, but our tour guide was horrible.  Not witty, not funny, not even that interesting.  He was clearly reading from a script because at one point he lost his place or got confused or something and ended up re-reciting the entire opening three minutes, word for word.  Most of the time he just but on a soundtrack, which clearly was way too short for the entire 90 minute tour since we listened to the Titanic song 4 times.  As a side note, you may not want to remind people of a huge boat accident when we're doing a boat tour... but that's just me.  \n\nDefinitely something for the older crowd, but even they seemed restless after about 45 minutes.",1 (2 stars)
"Came in and asked for a table and of the 15 tables, 2 were occupied and maybe 7 had dirty dishes on them. I was told I'd have to wait or go to the bar.  Retarded right? Fine.

Stayed at the hotel for 4 days. We ate breakfast here everyday and one dinner. The dinner left a lot to be desired. I ordered filet medium and it came out all red not medium. Waitress blamed it on st. Pats day specials. My daughter ordered a pasta and vegetable dish being vegan with oil on the side. It came all mixed together not on side.  \n\nShort order cook who does all eggs was fantastic! My wie ordered eggs benedict from kitchen rather tan wait in line for cooked to order.

"I've had a variety of experiences with Green Cab, ranging from average to terrible. \n\nTonight, a Friday night, I called a cab at 9:50pm to take me from one end of downtown to the other. Yes, a decently busy time to call, but nothing out of the ordinary. Although I'm willing to wait 15-25 minutes on a Friday night, I'm not willing to wait 50 minutes. By that point, your energy is exhausted from the frustration of waiting. \n\nIn general, Green Cab kind of blows. Yes, they have eco-friendly cars and sweet ipads, but that's really not what I want in a cab service. I'd rather have a short wait time or a reliable estimate if it's a busy period. With Green Cab, there's really no telling when they'll arrive. \n\nI've also had trouble paying on several occasions. Some of the drivers enjoying pulling the old \""my machine is broken\"" when you try to pay with credit cards, while others claim not to have any change for your $20. You're a cab driver. Your only responsibility is to drive, accept credit cards, and be able to make change. If you're missing 2 of those 3, you're doin' it wrong. \n\nAlso, if you're waiting for Green Cab and want to see where your cab is, forget it. Rather than placing your call on a hold line, Green Cab routes calls to a busy signal, so you're SOL in terms of following up when it's busy. \n\nOther than that, Green Cab is awesome. \n\nAll in all, I'd stick with Union Cab. You *might* pay more, but it's worth it. Plus, the drivers are way cooler. One even had Cash Cab-style questions ready to ask me at 3am. But maybe you're not into Cash Cab. So then there's always Green Cab.",0 (1 star)
"Love, love, love this spot!  One of my favorite things about staying at Planet Hollywood is being so close to Earls.  This delicious sandwich spot is open 24 hours...

My personal favorites are the chipotle chicken and veggie sandwich. \n\nWraps- They're fresh but nothing as tasty as the sandwiches.\n\nSalads- Small in size, but tasty. Try the Cobb.\n\nBaked Goods- ahhhh.... The cookies are moist and rich.  Although I'm usually a huge fan of chocolate chip cookies, the sugar cookie was my favorite in this case.  \n\nDon't let the long line discourage you!  They move pretty quickly, especially during the day.",4 (5 stars)
"I think this place has a bit of an identity crisis. It's either a fast casual restaurant or its a sit down restaurant. Unfortunately they are charging sit down prices for a fast casual, serve yourself environment. \n\nThe food was decent, but two kabobs dinners and a drink, which you have to get yourself was almost $28.  Wait, now that I think about it, one of the orders was a combo and we never got the onion rings (only choice because they ran out of fries).\n\nFor my liking, the music was a bit too loud. I also found the menu to be a little on the big side and pictures, as someone else mentioned would be a huge help.  A mediterranean/Indian place that serves great burgers could probably work, but you may want to advertise them a little more. Maybe a burger with these flavors and toppings could work to. \n\nAnother suggestion, I saw that the owner felt  it necessary to respond. When you do respond in such a way, it comes off as negative and makes you and your restaurant look bad. There is nothing wrong about being passionate, but I would respond a little differently. Something like \""I am sorry your experience with us did not meet your expectations. We will take your feedback as we continually strive to make our restaurant a better dining experience.\""\n\nI'm a fan of small business and I hope this one succeeds, but there are quite a few places in town to get good kabobs and Indian food.  I think once this place figures out exactly who they are, they can succeed.",2 (3 stars)
